Wages arrive via direct deposit, bills are paid online, and government benefits flow electronically -- yet according to the FDIC, 5.6 million households have no bank account, and another 19 million are underbanked. These families are forced to rely on check-cashing stores, payday lenders, and money orders that drain hundreds of dollars annually from those who can least afford it.</p> <p>The American Payment Network Act (APNA) establishes the American Payment Network -- a nationwide, utility-style payments infrastructure that guarantees every American access to a secure, fee-free digital account. Like the interstate highway system or rural electrification, the APN provides essential infrastructure that connects everyone to economic life while preserving private sector competition and innovation.</p> <p>Key Provisions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Network Accounts for everyone -- Fee-free digital accounts with no minimum balance, no overdraft fees, and no credit check requirements. Every lawful U.S. resident can hold an account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Technology-neutral access -- Accounts work through smartphones, web browsers, feature phones (SMS/USSD), ATMs, debit cards, and in-person services. No one is excluded based on the technology they own.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open participation for financial institutions -- Banks, credit unions, and fintechs can connect to the network as APN Agents, earning service fees while their customers retain fee-free access.</p> </li> <li> <p>USPS partnership for physical access -- Post offices become APN access points, bringing banking services to rural communities and urban neighborhoods where bank branches have closed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protections for vulnerable populations -- Independent account access for youth 16+, working minors, foster youth, homeless youth, and domestic abuse survivors, with privacy safeguards against financial exploitation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-sustaining infrastructure -- The American Payment Network Fund provides dedicated financing through transaction fees and interest earnings. Treasury borrowing authority enables immediate deployment with mandatory repayment from network revenues. No ongoing taxpayer cost; continuous operation during government shutdowns.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Primary Benefits:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Financial inclusion -- Eliminates the fees and barriers that exclude millions from the banking system. Check-cashing charges, money order costs, and predatory overdraft fees become unnecessary when free alternatives exist.</p> </li> <li> <p>Economic infrastructure -- Provides the foundation for efficient delivery of wages, benefits, tax refunds, and programs like the American Prosperity Stability Payment. Reduces government administrative costs and payment delays.</p> </li> <li> <p>Market-driven consumer protection -- Makes financial exploitation economically unviable through competition rather than complex regulation.

Competitive Displacement of Predatory Practices","text":"<p>APNA solves the problem of financial exploitation through competition rather than regulation.

Rather than prohibiting exploitation through law -- which requires enforcement, invites legal challenges, and remains vulnerable to political erosion -- APNA makes exploitation unprofitable. Banks and fintech firms can still offer premium services, rewards programs, and investment products, but they cannot charge predatory fees when a free baseline alternative exists.</p> <p>The result is market-driven consumer protection: stable, robust, and immune to regulatory capture.

Foundation for Broader Economic Stability","text":"<p>APNA is the technical precondition for seamless implementation of the American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA) and other nationwide payment programs. It provides the Treasury and states with real-time, low-cost rails for direct deposits, refunds, and stability payments, replacing ad-hoc systems that generate errors, delays, and fraud risk. In the larger architecture, APNA plays the same role for economic security that the interstate grid plays for transportation.</p> <p>Critically, APNA is designed as self-capitalizing infrastructure. The American Payment Network Fund, established within Treasury, receives revenues from network transaction fees, interest earnings, certification fees, and state cost-sharing payments. This dedicated funding stream eliminates dependence on annual appropriations, ensuring that critical payment infrastructure cannot be held hostage to budget negotiations or continuing resolution gaps. Treasury borrowing authority provides initial capitalization, with mandatory repayment from operational revenues -- the network pays for itself.</p>"},{"location":"aspc/APNA-Policy-Rationale/#5-fiscal-and-monetary-efficiency","title":"5.

It reduces the need for crisis legislation, temporary stimulus checks, and emergency appropriations.</p> <p>The self-funding model reinforces this efficiency. Transaction fees capped at five basis points (0.05%) generate sustainable operating revenue without burdening users or participating institutions. Interest earnings on settlement balances and Fund reserves provide additional revenue streams. The result is infrastructure that improves government fiscal operations while requiring no ongoing taxpayer subsidy after initial deployment.</p> <p>Most importantly, APNA's emergency operational authority ensures that payment infrastructure continues functioning during government shutdowns, appropriations lapses, or debt ceiling crises.

This precarity is not primarily a failure of individual effort or even of specific programs -- it reflects missing infrastructure that other developed nations take for granted.</p> <p>Three infrastructure gaps create compounding vulnerability across the lifecycle:</p> <p>The Payment Gap. Over 20 million Americans lack bank accounts entirely. Millions more are \"underbanked,\" relying on check-cashing services, prepaid cards, and payday lenders that extract billions annually in fees. When the federal government needs to reach these households -- stimulus payments, tax refunds, emergency assistance -- it struggles. The 2020-2021 pandemic relief experience demonstrated this failure at scale: months of delays, lost payments, hastily constructed workarounds that left the most vulnerable waiting longest.</p> <p>The Stability Gap. American workers face extraordinary economic volatility. Job loss, illness, family emergency, or economic downturn can rapidly exhaust household resources. Unlike peer nations, the United States provides no baseline income floor that prevents catastrophic descent. Existing safety net programs are fragmented, means-tested, stigmatized, and often unavailable to those who need them. Workers cannot negotiate effectively when the alternative to any job is destitution.</p> <p>The Child Investment Gap. American families bear extraordinary costs during the years that matter most for child development. The United States remains the only developed nation without a meaningful child allowance or paid family leave. Children in low-income families face developmental disadvantages that compound across generations -- not because their parents lack effort, but because the country lacks infrastructure to support families during critical periods.</p> <p>These gaps interact destructively. Without payment infrastructure, benefits cannot reach people efficiently. Without adult stability, households cannot weather disruptions or invest in their children's futures. Without child investment, poverty transmits across generations.</p> <p>The result is an economy where precarity undermines productivity, where household instability dampens long-term planning and investment, where consumer demand fluctuates unpredictably, and where children's potential is constrained by circumstances of birth.</p>"},{"location":"aspc/ASPC-Executive-Summary/#the-solution-integrated-economic-infrastructure-across-the-lifecycle","title":"THE SOLUTION: INTEGRATED ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE LIFECYCLE","text":"<p>The American Shared Prosperity Compact addresses all three gaps through a unified legislative framework.

APNA delivers value even if the other acts never pass. APSA can operate through existing Treasury systems if APNA never materializes. SOCA provides child benefits regardless of whether adult stability payments exist.</p> <p>But the acts are designed to integrate. When all three operate together, the system achieves maximum efficiency: enrollment infrastructure in APSA connects families to the payment network in APNA, and stability payments for adults (APSA) and children (SOCA) flow seamlessly without competing for resources.</p> <p>This modular design is deliberate.

Accounts integrate with existing private banking; users can link their preferred bank or use the Network Account as their primary account.</p> <p>APN Agents are the service layer. Banks, credit unions, fintech companies, and the U.S. Postal Service can become certified agents, providing account access and services to their communities. This distributed model ensures geographic coverage without requiring Treasury to build branch infrastructure.

Recipients can still choose direct deposit to private banks or paper checks, but Network Accounts provide the fastest, most reliable delivery. This alone saves the federal government hundreds of millions annually in check printing and prepaid card fees.</p> <p>For the estimated 20+ million unbanked Americans, APNA provides something they have never had: free, reliable access to the financial system.

As income rises, the income-adjusted component phases out smoothly (no benefit cliffs), ensuring work always pays. At higher incomes, households receive only the baseline; at the clean exit threshold (10x FPL / ~$150,600), even the baseline phases out -- but this affects only about 10% of American adults. Nine in ten adults receive direct payments.</p> <p>The American Prosperity Contribution (APC) funds the system at a rate of 12%. The APC is a contribution on goods and services sold for domestic consumption, collected at each stage of production and distribution. The APC is not an additional tax on top of existing revenue -- it funds the APSP directly, creating a clear reciprocal relationship: everyone contributes through consumption, everyone benefits through stability payments.</p> <p>State Revenue Sharing allocates 20% of APC revenue to state governments -- approximately $312 billion annually -- distributed via pure population share with no federal mandates on usage. States report annually on fund allocation through a standardized transparency framework, enabling citizens to hold state governments accountable for how they use their share. This provides states with stable, predictable revenue while preserving state autonomy over allocation decisions.</p> <p>The Stability Buffer reserves a portion of revenue to prevent procyclical adjustments during recessions.

Nearly half lack savings to cover three months of expenses. Over 20 million have no bank account at all, paying predatory fees just to access their own wages. American families bear extraordinary costs during the years that matter most for child development -- the United States remains the only developed nation without a meaningful child allowance. When government assistance arrives, the people who need it most wait longest or never receive it because infrastructure designed for a different era cannot reach them.</p> <p>The American Shared Prosperity Compact builds the economic infrastructure America lacks: a modern payment network, monthly stability payments for adults, and investment in every child from birth through age 18. Three integrated acts work together to create lifecycle economic security -- or each can pass independently to deliver immediate value.</p> <p>The Three Acts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>American Payment Network Act (APNA) creates fee-free digital accounts for every American through a nationwide network of banks, credit unions, fintechs, and post offices -- ending financial exclusion and modernizing how government delivers payments</p> </li> <li> <p>American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA) provides monthly income-adjusted stability payments funded by the 12% American Prosperity Contribution, with 20% of revenue (~$312 billion annually) shared with states -- creating an economic floor for nine in ten American adults</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure Our Children Act (SOCA) delivers $460/month per child plus a $2,000 Birth Support Payment, funded by the Child Security Contribution -- ensuring every child has a foundation for development regardless of family circumstances</p> </li> </ul> <p>What Passage Accomplishes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Lifecycle economic security: From birth support through childhood investment to adult stability payments, no American falls through the cracks at any stage of life</p> </li> <li> <p>Financial inclusion at scale: 20+ million unbanked Americans gain free access to the modern financial system; billions saved annually as predatory fees are eliminated</p> </li> <li> <p>Dramatic reduction in child poverty: Consistent monthly support during critical developmental years, with research showing significant improvements in health, education, and economic outcomes</p> </li> <li> <p>Stable state funding: States receive predictable revenue through population-based sharing with full autonomy over allocation -- no federal mandates, standardized transparency reporting</p> </li> </ul> <p>The Compact is designed for political durability.

That expansion proved dramatic improvement is possible -- child poverty dropped by nearly half -- but when it expired, poverty rates rebounded immediately. American children deserve lasting investment, not temporary measures subject to political winds.</p> <p>The Secure Our Children Act (SOCA) establishes a permanent, fully refundable child tax credit with monthly payments, a one-time Birth Support Payment for new parents, and dedicated funding through the Child Security Contribution. This architecture provides adequate support for American families while ensuring fiscal sustainability independent of annual appropriations battles.</p> <p>Key Provisions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Enhanced child tax credit: $3,600 per year ($300/month) for children under 6; $3,000 per year ($250/month) for children ages 6-17. Fully refundable regardless of earned income. Universal benefit for every qualifying child -- no phase-out based on parental income.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monthly advance payments: Predictable monthly delivery matching family expenses, with opt-out available and safe harbor protection against overpayment liability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Birth Support Payment: $2,000 one-time payment upon birth or adoption, with advance payment option up to 60 days before due date. Includes compassionate provisions for stillbirth and infant loss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dedicated funding: Child Security Contribution of 1.50% of income (plus 3.00% on income above $500,000) creates sustainable revenue without competing in annual budget battles. Progressive design ensures high earners are net contributors even while their children receive full benefits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Automatic stabilization: Self-adjusting rate mechanism responds to funding fluctuations without requiring Congressional action, with bounds preventing extreme changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Program coordination: Credit and Birth Support Payments are excluded from income calculations for APSA Stability Payments and federal means-tested programs, preventing benefit clawbacks.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Primary Benefits:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For children: Approximately 70 million children gain access to enhanced support regardless of parental employment status or income, with early childhood receiving higher investment during the developmentally critical years. The credit is for the child, not the parent.</p> </li> <li> <p>For families: Monthly payments provide predictable income that reduces reliance on high-cost credit. Low-income families without earned income -- currently excluded under existing law -- receive full benefits.

Children do not choose their parents. They do not choose their family's income level, employment status, or economic circumstances. A child born to billionaires did not earn that fortune; a child born into poverty did not cause that condition. Support for children should recognize this fundamental reality.</p> <p>This principle has a concrete policy implication: SOCA provides the same benefit amount for every qualifying child regardless of parental income. There is no phase-out based on household earnings. Every child from birth through age 17 receives identical support: $3,600 annually for children under 6, $3,000 for children 6-17, plus the $2,000 Birth Support Payment.</p> <p>Progressivity -- the principle that those with greater means should contribute more -- is handled entirely through the Child Security Contribution's rate structure. High-earning families are substantial net contributors to the program even while their children receive the same benefit as every other child.

Every American who earns income contributes to the Child Security Contribution -- not because children are a \"burden\" to be distributed, but because a society that invests in its children reaps collective returns in economic productivity, social stability, and democratic vitality. The contribution is universal but progressive: everyone participates, but those with greater means contribute proportionally more through the income-based kicker.</p> <p>This represents a philosophical departure from general-revenue funding, which treats child benefits as discretionary spending competing with defense, infrastructure, and every other government priority. Instead, the Child Security Contribution creates a dedicated social compact: Americans contribute to child security throughout their working lives, and children receive support regardless of whether their parents happened to have earned income in any particular year.</p>"},{"location":"aspc/SOCA-Policy-Rationale/#adequacy-of-benefit","title":"Adequacy of Benefit","text":"<p>A child benefit that lifts children from deep poverty into less-deep poverty fails as policy and fails as politics.

Combined with the $2,000 Birth Support Payment, SOCA provides support scaled to actual family costs during the most resource-intensive and economically vulnerable periods of child-rearing.</p> <p>The age-differentiated structure reflects the research consensus that early childhood represents both the highest cost period (requiring intensive care, often with a parent reducing work) and the highest-return period for developmental investment.

Permanence requires fiscal durability (dedicated funding that doesn't compete in annual appropriations battles), political durability (broad-based contribution creating stakeholder investment), and administrative durability (systems built for ongoing operation rather than emergency improvisation).

The policy choice to let the expansion expire was also a choice to accept the poverty rates that followed.</p> <p>The pre-2021 child tax credit structure embodied a contradiction: it offered the least support to children in the poorest families.

High-income families are net contributors to the program through the Child Security Contribution; they receive the same benefit for their children because children's worthiness of support does not depend on their parents' earnings.</p>"},{"location":"aspc/SOCA-Policy-Rationale/#monthly-advance-payments","title":"Monthly Advance Payments","text":"<p>Lump-sum tax refunds fail to match the rhythm of family expenses. Rent is due monthly; groceries are purchased weekly. The 2021 experience demonstrated monthly payments are feasible and valued.

The two-year trigger prevents overreaction to single-year fluctuations while allowing timely response to sustained imbalances.

But dedicated funding provides stability, creates stakeholder investment, and forces honest accounting that general revenue funding cannot match.

Moreover, wealthy families are massive net contributors to the program. A household earning $1,000,000 contributes $15,000-$60,000 while receiving $6,000 for two children. The program is deeply progressive even though every child receives the same benefit.</p>"},{"location":"aspc/SOCA-Policy-Rationale/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>SOCA represents a deliberate architectural choice: to build child benefit policy on a foundation capable of bearing permanent weight. The combination of adequate benefits, universal contribution, and self-stabilizing funding mechanisms creates a structure that can endure political and economic cycles without constant reconstruction.</p> <p>The alternative is the status quo -- periodic expansions followed by expirations, political battles every budget cycle, and outcomes that treat millions of children as acceptable casualties of political dysfunction. SOCA offers a different path: a national commitment to child security, funded through shared responsibility, designed for permanence, and extended to every child equally because every child deserves no less.</p> <p>Prepared by: Albert E.
