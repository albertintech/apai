# 🇺🇸 American Policy Architecture Institute (APAI)

**Blueprints for a stronger and more dynamic Republic**

The American Policy Architecture Institute develops comprehensive legislative blueprints to repair, maintain, and strengthen the civic systems designed to serve *We The People*. Each proposal provides complete statutory language, policy rationale, and supporting analysis -- not white papers or wish lists, but detailed modernization plans ready for serious evaluation.

## Approach

APAI treats democratic institutions as engineered systems requiring periodic maintenance. Proposals are structured as integrated reforms addressing root causes of institutional dysfunction, not symptoms. The portfolio is nonpartisan by design -- these are structural problems that produce predictable failures regardless of which party holds power.

## Portfolio

- **🏛️ Congressional Modernization Framework (CMF)** -- Integrated electoral and procedural modernization for Congress, combining the Federal Elections Modernization Act and Office of Congressional Procedure Act
- **💰 American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC)** -- Coordinated economic security through universal stability payments, public payment infrastructure, and permanent expanded child benefits
- **⚖️ Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA)** -- Structural reform of federal courts including circuit reorganization, Supreme Court expansion, and binding judicial ethics
- **💼 Civil Service Accountability Act (CSAA)** -- Professional civil service modernization modeled on the military officer corps, reducing political appointments from ~4,000 to ~1,000
- **🔍 Congressional Capacity Commission Act (CCC)** -- Independent assessment of congressional institutional capacity with investment recommendations
- **📋 Candidate Verification and Transparency Act (CVTA)** -- Standardized federal candidate verification replacing adversarial discovery with systematic procedures
