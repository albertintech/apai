## UNDERSTANDING YOUR BALLOT

### Party Registration vs. Party Endorsements

**Party Registration** (shown in the table):
- Shows which party, if any, the candidate is registered with
- Examples: Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, Green, none

**Party Endorsements** (shown in the table):
- Shows which parties formally endorsed this candidate
- Candidates may receive up to three endorsements
- Some candidates may have no party endorsements

**What the Endorsements Tell You:**

- **Libertarian | Libertarian, Forward** (Patterson) = Libertarian with additional Forward Party endorsement showing cross-coalition reform appeal
- **Democratic | Democratic, Working Families** (Nguyen) = Democrat with progressive coalition support
- **Democratic | Democratic** (Thompson) = Democrat with party endorsement only
- **Democratic | none** (Robinson) = Registered Democrat but party chose not to endorse (or endorsed other candidates)
- **Republican | Republican** (Williams, Carter) = Republicans with party endorsement
- **Republican | none** (Hayes) = Registered Republican but party chose not to endorse
- **none | Independent** (Santos) = True independent without party registration
- **Green | Green, Working Families** (Cruz) = Green Party with labor coalition endorsement

**Why Some Candidates Have No Endorsements:**

Some registered party members (Robinson, Hayes) don't have their party's endorsement. This could mean:
- The party chose to endorse different candidates from their party
- The candidate is running without seeking party endorsement
- Internal party disagreements over the candidate

This information helps you understand party dynamics and coalition relationships.

### About the FCAO Exam

All candidates for federal office are required to take the **Federal Candidate Assessment Office (FCAO)** examination, which tests knowledge of:

- U.S. Constitutional structure and principles
- Federal government powers and limitations
- Bill of Rights and civil liberties
- Legislative, executive, and judicial branch functions
- Historical context of American governance

The FCAO examination is a **transparency mechanism, not a qualification barrier**. No minimum score is required -- candidates scoring 0% may still run and serve if voters choose them. Scores are displayed on ballots to help voters assess candidates' understanding of constitutional governance and federal office responsibilities.

Candidates may retake the exam unlimited times, with only their highest score reported.

**FCAO Exam Scores in This Election:**
- **90%+ (3 candidates):** Patterson (94%), Nguyen (93%), Thompson (91%)
- **85-89% (4 candidates):** Santos (89%), Cruz (88%), Williams (87%), Robinson (85%)
- **80-84% (1 candidate):** Carter (82%)
- **Below 80% (1 candidate):** Hayes (78%)

## HOW STAR VOTING WORKS WITH MULTIPLE CANDIDATES

With nine candidates on this ballot, STAR voting ensures the winner has broad support -- not just a plurality of a fragmented vote.

### The Two-Step Process

**Step 1: Scoring Round**
- All your scores for all nine candidates are totaled across all ballots
- The two candidates with the highest total scores become **finalists**
- This ensures the finalists have broad appeal, not just intense support from a narrow base

**Step 2: Automatic Runoff**
- Your ballot is examined to see which finalist you scored higher
- Your full vote goes to that finalist
- The finalist preferred by more voters **wins the election**
- This ensures the winner has majority support between the top two

### Why This Matters with Nine Candidates

Under the old plurality system, nine candidates would split the vote badly. A candidate could win with 15-20% support while 80-85% of voters preferred someone else.

STAR voting solves this:
- **Your honest scores all count** toward determining the finalists
- **No vote-splitting** -- supporting similar candidates doesn't hurt your side
- **The winner must be broadly acceptable** -- high total scores require appeal beyond your base
- **Majority preference guaranteed** -- the runoff ensures the winner beats the other finalist head-to-head

### Example

Imagine your scores are:
- Patterson: ⑤ (5 stars)
- Nguyen: ④ (4 stars)
- Cruz: ③ (3 stars)
- Thompson: ③ (3 stars)
- Santos: ② (2 stars)
- Robinson: ② (2 stars)
- Williams: ① (1 star)
- Carter: ⓪ (0 stars)
- Hayes: ⓪ (0 stars)

**Scoring Round:** All nine scores count toward determining the two finalists.

**If Patterson and Nguyen are the finalists:** Your vote goes to Patterson (you scored Patterson 5, Nguyen 4)

**If Nguyen and Thompson are the finalists:** Your vote goes to Nguyen (you scored Nguyen 4, Thompson 3)

**If Thompson and Williams are the finalists:** Your vote goes to Thompson (you scored Thompson 3, Williams 1)

Your ratings ensure your preferences count no matter which two candidates make the runoff.

---

## WHY RATE ALL CANDIDATES?

Rating all nine candidates is important because:

1. **You don't know who the finalists will be**: Your scores for all candidates help determine which two advance to the runoff
2. **Prevent unwanted outcomes**: Rating candidates you oppose as ⓪ reduces their chances of becoming finalists
3. **Express nuanced preferences**: You can show different levels of support (or opposition) rather than just picking one
4. **Ensure your runoff vote counts**: When the two finalists are determined, your preference between them determines where your vote goes

**You can't hurt your favorite by rating others!** Your favorite getting ⑤ is absolute support. Rating others honestly only helps ensure acceptable candidates make the runoff.
