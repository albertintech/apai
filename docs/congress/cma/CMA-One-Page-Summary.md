## The Problem

The House hasn't grown since 1913. The population has tripled. Each representative now serves 760,000 constituents -- six times larger districts than comparable democracies. Congressional staff drain to better-paying executive agencies and lobbying firms, hollowing out legislative expertise. Winner-take-all elections produce representatives who fail to reflect their communities, while fifty different state ballot access regimes create administrative burden and litigation risk.

These aren't moral failures -- they're maintenance needs that have gone unaddressed for over a century.

## The Solution

The Congressional Modernization Act pairs institutional capacity reforms with integrated electoral updates achieving full implementation within approximately 14 years -- three presidential terms. Members who vote for CMA see results during their careers.

Electoral reforms launch together at the First CMA Election as a unified system -- STAR voting, multi-member districts, and House expansion debut simultaneously, producing "the new Congress" rather than amplifying existing dysfunction.

## Key Provisions

- **House Expansion:** Growth from 435 to approximately 720 representatives over 14 years, reducing average district size from 760,000 to 465,000 constituents. Expansion adds seats -- no incumbent displacement.

- **Legislative Capacity:** Enhanced staff budgets and professional development funding reduce talent drain to executive agencies and lobbying firms. Members gain resources for substantive policy work rather than perpetual fundraising.

- **STAR Voting:** Score-based voting (0-5 stars per candidate) for all federal elections eliminates vote-splitting and spoiler effects while ensuring winners have broad support.

- **Multi-Member Districts:** House districts transition from single-member to multi-member configuration (3-7 seats) using proportional representation, eliminating the geometric distortions inherent in winner-take-all systems. Multi-member districts were standard American practice from 1789 through 1967.

- **Candidate Transparency:** The Federal Candidate Assessment Office administers standardized competency examinations with scores displayed on ballots. Voters remain sole gatekeepers -- no minimum score required for ballot access.

## What Passage Accomplishes

- **Real competition:** STAR voting eliminates the spoiler effect, giving independents and third-party candidates genuine viability without "wasting" votes. Voters can support their true preferences.

- **Reform on a human timescale:** Full implementation within three presidential terms -- not generational timelines that outlive political accountability.

- **Geometry-proof representation:** Multi-member districts with proportional representation eliminate gerrymandering's effectiveness regardless of which party draws the maps.

- **Constitutional foundation:** Operates within clear Elections Clause authority and congressional house-sizing powers validated by Supreme Court precedent. Every reform draws on American historical practice.
