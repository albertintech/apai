# CMA House Member Guide

## The Opportunity and the Honest Reality

The Congressional Modernization Act represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put the Republic on solid institutional footing for the next 250 years. It also changes the electoral landscape in ways that will reward some skills and diminish others.

This document is not a sales pitch. It will not tell you that CMA protects your seat or guarantees your reelection. Some members will thrive under the new system. Others will not. The ones who adapt will have significant advantages. The ones who coast on structural advantages that no longer exist will struggle.

That is how democratic reform is supposed to work.

What this document offers instead is honest guidance: what actually changes, when it changes, what skills transfer, what skills you need to develop, and how to navigate the transition. Think of it as a player's guide to the new Congress.

## What Actually Changes Under CMA

### The Tiered Effective Date Structure

CMA uses a tiered triggering system that phases in different provisions at different times:

| Tier | What Takes Effect | When |
|------|-------------------|------|
| **Tier 1** | Title VI (compensation, professional development), Title VII (enforcement), Title VIII (general provisions) | Upon enactment |
| **Tier 2** | Titles I-IV (ballot access, party recognition, House expansion, electoral reform) | First CMA Election |
| **Tier 3** | Title V (FCAO examinations) | Second CMA Election |

**The First CMA Election** is defined as the second regularly scheduled general election after enactment, with an 18-month minimum runway. If CMA passes in early 2026, the First CMA Election would be November 2028.

### The House Expansion Schedule

CMA uses accelerated expansion rather than a 25-year phased approach:

| Election | House Size | Change |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Current | 435 | -- |
| First CMA Election (~2028) | 510 | +75 |
| ~2030 | 545 | +35 |
| ~2032 | 580 | +35 |
| ~2034 | 615 | +35 |
| ~2036 | 650 | +35 |
| ~2038 | 685 | +35 |
| ~2040 | 720 | +35 (cube root compliance) |

Cube root compliance is reached in approximately 14 years -- three presidential terms. Members who vote for CMA will see results during their careers.

### Electoral System Changes at the First CMA Election

Everything launches together as an integrated system:

**STAR Voting:** Score Then Automatic Runoff replaces plurality voting in all federal elections. Voters score candidates 0-5; the two highest-scoring candidates advance to an automatic runoff determined by preference.

**Unified General Election Structure:** All federal elections use single general elections. No state-administered primaries. Qualified candidates appear directly on the November ballot with party endorsements and (starting at Second CMA Election) FCAO scores displayed. This applies uniformly to House, Senate, and Presidential elections.

**Multi-Member Districts:** Initial rollout begins at the First CMA Election. States with sufficient population begin transitioning to 3-7 seat districts using STAR-PR (proportional representation).

**Joint Endorsement Lists:** Candidates may display up to three party endorsements on the ballot, making coalition structures transparent to voters.

### FCAO Examinations at the Second CMA Election

The Federal Candidate Assessment Office begins administering examinations at the Second CMA Election (approximately 2030). Key features:

- Non-qualifying: No minimum score required to run or serve
- Unlimited retakes with only highest score reported
- Year-round availability at nationwide testing centers
- Separate House and Senate examinations
- Scores appear on ballot as voter information, not gatekeeping

## A Tale of Two Representatives: The Martinez Scenarios

Consider Representative Martinez, who currently holds a competitive district with approximately 30% fervent base support and wins general elections with 51-52% margins.

Martinez faces a choice: adapt to the new system or try to maintain familiar patterns.

### Scenario A: Martinez Coasts

**Decision:** "I'll keep doing what I've always done. These reforms will shake out somehow."

**First CMA Election (~2028):** Martinez's district transitions to multi-member representation as part of a five-seat regional district. Martinez continues the old campaign playbook -- triangulating between base and swing voters, focusing on the same donor networks, treating the election like a single-member race.

The problem: in a five-seat district, Martinez doesn't need 51% anymore. Martinez needs approximately 16-20% to secure one seat. But Martinez hasn't built the kind of durable base loyalty that proportional systems reward. The 30% "fervent base" was never cultivated as a base -- it was taken for granted while Martinez chased swing voters.

Other candidates -- including a newcomer with strong grassroots energy -- have spent the transition period building genuine coalition support. They understand that proportional representation rewards depth of support, not breadth of lukewarm acceptance.

Martinez wins a seat with 22% support in the first multi-member election, but it's closer than expected. The warning signs are there.

**2030-2034:** Martinez continues the old approach. FCAO scores appear on ballots starting in 2030. Martinez took the exam once, scored 71%, and hasn't retaken it. A challenger who spent two years studying scores 84%.

The coalition dynamics of multi-member districts continue to evolve. Candidates who built reciprocal endorsement networks and genuine base relationships outperform those who didn't. Martinez's support slowly erodes from 22% to 19% to 17%.

**2036:** A new candidate emerges who has done the adaptation work Martinez skipped. Strong FCAO score. Deep base relationships. Coalition endorsements from allied candidates. Genuine constituent service reputation built through enhanced MRA resources.

Martinez's 17% support falls below the effective threshold. After 20 years in Congress, Martinez loses -- not to a scandal or a wave election, but to a candidate who simply adapted better to the new system.

**Career outcome:** Martinez served during a historic transition but failed to evolve with it. The skills that won elections under the old system -- swing voter triangulation, donor network maintenance, cautious positioning -- were the wrong skills for the new system.

---

### Scenario B: Martinez Adapts

**Decision:** "The rules are changing. I need to develop new skills."

**Transition Period (2026-2028):** Before the First CMA Election, Martinez begins the adaptation work:

*Base cultivation:* Instead of triangulating toward swing voters, Martinez focuses on deepening relationships with the 30% base. What do they actually care about? What constituent services matter most to them? Martinez begins treating them as a durable coalition to cultivate rather than a foundation to take for granted.

*Coalition building:* Martinez reaches out to candidates who will share the multi-member district. Which ones have compatible but not identical bases? Can they build reciprocal endorsement relationships? Martinez attends to the coalition dynamics that proportional systems reward.

*FCAO preparation:* Martinez takes the examination early -- in 2027, well before scores appear on ballots. First attempt: 68%. Martinez uses congressional resources and institutional knowledge to study systematically. Second attempt in early 2028: 77%. Third attempt later in 2028: 85%. By the time FCAO scores appear on ballots in 2030, Martinez displays a strong score built through genuine competency development.

*Enhanced capacity:* Martinez uses the immediate Title VI benefits -- professional development resources, enhanced MRA once multi-member districts activate -- to build better constituent services. More staff. Better casework. Genuine responsiveness that builds the kind of loyalty proportional systems reward.

**First CMA Election (~2028):** Martinez enters the five-seat district election with preparation complete. The 30% base has been cultivated into genuine 28% durable support. Coalition relationships with allied candidates create reciprocal endorsement benefits. FCAO preparation is underway.

Martinez wins a seat with 28% support -- well above the ~16-20% threshold.

**2030-2040:** Martinez continues building. FCAO score improves to 89% by 2032. Base relationships deepen. Coalition partnerships mature. Enhanced MRA resources translate into constituent service infrastructure that competitors can't match.

By 2036, Martinez is one of the most effective members in the multi-member district -- not because of structural protection, but because of genuine adaptation and skill development. Martinez retires in 2042 after 26 years in Congress, having successfully navigated the transition.

**Career outcome:** Martinez recognized that the rules were changing and invested in developing the skills the new system rewards. The same person with the same starting position produced dramatically different outcomes based on adaptation choices.

## What Matters Less, What Matters More

### What Matters Less

**Safe district boundaries:** Gerrymandering becomes mathematically ineffective under proportional representation. Districts can still be drawn, but the winner-take-all dynamic that makes gerrymandering powerful disappears.

**Primary vulnerability:** No primaries exist under the unified general election structure. The threat of being "primaried" from your flank disappears entirely.

**Swing voter triangulation:** You don't need 50%+1 anymore. Chasing the median voter while neglecting your base becomes counterproductive.

**Geographic lock-in:** Safe districts based on geographic sorting matter less when districts are larger and multi-member. The structural advantages of favorable district lines diminish.

### What Matters More

**Base cultivation:** Proportional representation rewards depth of support. A genuine 20% who strongly support you beats a lukewarm 45% who merely prefer you to the alternative.

**Coalition relationships:** Multi-member districts create opportunities for reciprocal endorsements, shared campaign infrastructure, and coalition building. Members who invest in these relationships will outperform those who don't.

**Demonstrated competence:** FCAO scores appear on ballots. Members who take preparation seriously will display that competence publicly. Those who don't will display that choice publicly as well.

**Authentic representation:** Proportional representation lets you represent your actual ideological constituency. You don't need 50%+1; you need your base. Strong positions that energize your coalition are more valuable than cautious positions that offend no one.

**What to develop:** Figure out what you actually believe. Represent it authentically. Your base will reward conviction; swing voters are no longer the margin of victory.

## The Honest Bottom Line

CMA changes the game. Some members will thrive. Others will not.

The members who thrive will be those who:

- Cultivate durable base support rather than chasing swing voters
- Build coalition relationships with natural allies
- Take FCAO preparation seriously as genuine competency development
- Use enhanced resources to provide excellent constituent service
- Represent their constituencies authentically rather than triangulating constantly

The members who struggle will be those who:

- Rely on structural advantages that no longer exist
- Continue old campaign playbooks in a new electoral environment
- Treat FCAO as a nuisance rather than an opportunity
- Take their base for granted while chasing voters who no longer determine outcomes
- Fail to build the coalition relationships proportional systems reward

This is not a threat. It is an honest description of how democratic reform works. The new system rewards different skills than the old system. Those skills are learnable. The question is whether you invest in learning them.

The Republic benefits either way. CMA creates a Congress that better represents the American people, with members who have demonstrated competency, built genuine coalitions, and earned durable support from constituents who chose them with full information.

If you adapt, you have significant advantages: name recognition, institutional knowledge, existing relationships, constituent service infrastructure, and years to prepare while challengers build from scratch.

If you don't adapt, you will be replaced by someone who did.

That is how it should be.

## Appendix: FCAO as Incumbent Advantage

Critics sometimes portray FCAO examinations as threatening to incumbents. The opposite is true -- but only if you take preparation seriously.

### The Structural Advantages You Have

**Time:** You can take the exam in Year 1 of your current term, retake it multiple times over years, and display your highest score by your next election. Challengers must prepare during compressed campaign timelines.

**Staff support:** You have paid staff who can help organize study materials, research constitutional questions, and manage your preparation. Most challengers don't.

**Institutional knowledge:** You understand congressional procedure, constitutional structure, and legislative process from actually doing the job. The FCAO examination tests exactly this knowledge. You live the material; challengers must study it academically.

**Unlimited retakes:** Only your highest score ever appears. Early attempts are practice runs. Challengers face one-shot pressure during campaigns.

**Lower stakes per attempt:** You can take the exam "just to see" without campaign pressure. Each retake is a free option to improve your public credential.

### The Strategy

- **Year 1:** Take exam to establish baseline. Score doesn't matter yet.
- **Years 1-2:** Study weak areas systematically using congressional resources.
- **Year 2:** Retake exam. Improve score.
- **Year 3:** Retake again if needed. Optimize.
- **Year 4:** Display highest score on reelection ballot.

A challenger who declares candidacy 12 months before the election must study while fundraising, organizing, and campaigning. They take the exam under time pressure and display whatever score they achieve.

You've had years to optimize. The asymmetry is substantial -- but only if you actually use it.

### The Deeper Point

FCAO preparation makes you better at your job. The examination covers material every legislator should understand: constitutional structure, legislative procedure, policy fundamentals, oversight responsibilities.

Treating FCAO as genuine competency development rather than a test to game produces two benefits: a higher score, and improved effectiveness as a legislator. The latter builds the reputation that earns votes regardless of what appears on the ballot.

## Appendix: Financial Provisions Summary

### Immediate Benefits (Upon Enactment)

| Provision | House | Senate | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Year 1 Salary | $189,200 | $199,200 | 8.7% increase from current |
| Year 5 Salary | $250,000 | $300,000 | Phased increases |
| Professional Development | $12,500/year | $15,000/year | 5% of salary |
| Pension Accrual | 2.5% | 2.5% | Up from 1.7% |
| COLA | Automatic | Automatic | Tied to Employment Cost Index |

### Multi-Member District Benefits (First CMA Election+)

| Provision | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Enhanced MRA | +35% (~$450-550k/year) | Additional staff, district offices, constituent services |
| Public Matching | 6:1 up to $5M | Neutralizes wealthy self-funded challengers |

### Career Value Impact

Conservative estimate for 10-year House career under CMA vs. current system: approximately +$3M in total compensation value (salary increases, enhanced pension, professional development, MRA capacity).

This is not the reason to support CMA. But it is relevant to understanding what the legislation provides.
