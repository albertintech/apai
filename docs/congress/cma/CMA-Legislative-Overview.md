# The Congressional Modernization Act (CMA)

## Legislative Overview

### Published January 2026

---

**A comprehensive description of the Congressional Modernization Act's structure, provisions, and implementation timeline**

---

## Purpose of This Document

This overview provides a systematic walk-through of the Congressional Modernization Act, describing what the legislation does without advocacy or defense. It serves as a reference guide for understanding the Act's comprehensive reform architecture across eight integrated titles.

The CMA addresses what might be called the "maintenance and modernization needs" of American representative democracy -- updating electoral infrastructure, expanding institutional capacity, and aligning incentive structures to enable effective 21st-century governance.

---

## I. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

The Congressional Modernization Act consists of eight titles that work as an integrated system:

**Title I: Federal Ballot Access Standards** establishes uniform requirements for candidates seeking ballot access in federal elections, replacing fifty different state regimes with clear federal standards.

**Title II: Federal Political Party Recognition** creates a federal framework for recognizing political parties and implementing Joint Endorsement Lists, allowing multiple parties to endorse the same candidate on federal ballots.

**Title III: House Membership Expansion** expands the House of Representatives from 435 to approximately 720 members over approximately 14 years through an initial expansion followed by biennial increases, improving representation ratios and institutional capacity.

**Title IV: Multi-Member Districts and STAR-PR** transitions congressional districts from single-member to multi-member configuration using proportional representation, eliminating the mathematical distortions inherent in winner-take-all systems.

**Title V: Non-Qualifying Federal Office Examinations** establishes the Federal Candidate Assessment Office (FCAO) to administer standardized competency examinations for all federal candidates, with results displayed on ballots for voter information.

**Title VI: Transition, Compensation, and Implementation** provides immediate compensation and capacity improvements for current members while establishing transition protections that phase in as electoral reforms are implemented.

**Title VII: Enforcement, Reporting, and Oversight** establishes enforcement mechanisms, reporting requirements, judicial review procedures, and transition support infrastructure.

**Title VIII: General Provisions** addresses severability, constitutional supremacy, effective dates, and technical definitions including the critical "First CMA Election" and "Second CMA Election" triggers.

The legislation addresses a fundamental political economy problem: electoral reforms typically require incumbents to vote away their own advantages. The CMA resolves this by providing substantial immediate benefits to all current members upon enactment while launching integrated electoral reforms at the First CMA Election.

---

## II. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

The CMA's reforms implement through a tiered effective date structure designed to provide immediate member benefits, ensure simultaneous integrated launch of electoral reforms, and allow adequate development time for FCAO examinations.

### Tier 1: Immediate upon Enactment

**Title VI (Compensation and Capacity):** All compensation provisions take effect immediately upon enactment, including phased salary increases, enhanced pension formula, professional development allowances, and streamlined Senate appointment authority.

**Title VII (Enforcement):** FEC and DOJ receive immediate authority to begin rulemaking, issue guidance, and prepare for implementation.

**Title VIII (General Provisions):** Definitions, severability, and administrative authorities become operative from Day One to provide legal scaffolding.

### Tier 2: First CMA Election

The "First CMA Election" is defined as the second regularly scheduled general election for Congress occurring after enactment, except that if such second election occurs less than eighteen (18) months after enactment, the First CMA Election shall instead be the third regularly scheduled general election after enactment. This ensures a minimum 18-month runway for state preparation.

At the First CMA Election, the following provisions take effect simultaneously:

**Title I (Ballot Access):** Federal ballot access standards become operative for all federal elections.

**Title II (Party Recognition):** Federal party recognition framework and Joint Endorsement Lists take effect.

**Title III (House Expansion):** House expands to 510 members. Biennial +35 seat increases begin with subsequent Congresses.

**Title IV (Multi-Member Districts):** Multi-member districts begin phasing in at 25% (Transition Cycle 1). STAR voting implemented for all federal elections.

### Tier 3: Second CMA Election

The "Second CMA Election" is defined as the first regularly scheduled general election for Congress occurring after the First CMA Election.

**Title V (FCAO):** Federal Candidate Assessment Office examinations become mandatory. FCAO scores appear on ballots for first time. The decoupled timeline provides 36-42 months for proper exam development, pilot testing, and validation.

### Ongoing: Biennial Increases

Beginning with the second Congress elected after initial expansion, House membership increases by 35 seats each Congress until reaching the cube root of the national population (approximately 720 members). This achieves cube root compliance within approximately 14 years -- three presidential terms.

### Timeline Summary

| Trigger | Provisions | Approximate Timing |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Enactment | Titles VI, VII, VIII | Day One |
| First CMA Election | Titles I, II, III, IV | ~2-3 years after enactment |
| Second CMA Election | Title V | ~4-5 years after enactment |
| Biennial increases | Title III ongoing | Every 2 years until cube root |
| Cube root compliance | Title III terminates | ~14 years after enactment |

This structure ensures members receive immediate benefits while electoral reforms launch together as an integrated system, producing "the new Congress" rather than "more of the old Congress."

---

## III. TITLE I: FEDERAL BALLOT ACCESS STANDARDS

Title I establishes uniform federal requirements for ballot access in federal elections, exercising Congress's clear authority under the Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4, Clause 1). Currently, fifty different state ballot access regimes create varying signature requirements from 100 to over 100,000, inconsistent filing deadlines, different petition formats, and substantial litigation exposure.

### Three Paths to Ballot Access

The Act creates three alternative pathways for candidates to achieve ballot access:

**Major Party Nomination**: Candidates nominated by federally recognized political parties whose candidate for the same office received at least 5% of votes in the most recent election automatically qualify for ballot access.

**Signature Petition**: Candidates may qualify by collecting petition signatures equal to 0.5% of votes cast for that office in the most recent election. The Act caps requirements at 5,000 signatures for statewide offices and 1,000 signatures for House districts. States must provide at least 120 days for signature collection and must accept signatures from any registered voter in the jurisdiction regardless of party affiliation. Electronic signature collection through FEC-approved secure methods is permitted.

**Filing Fee Alternative**: Candidates may pay a filing fee not exceeding $1,000 for House seats or $2,500 for statewide offices, with amounts adjusted annually for inflation. This provides an efficiency path for candidates with resources while keeping fees modest enough to avoid wealth barriers.

### Additional Requirements

States must establish filing deadlines at least 120 days before elections to provide adequate time for signature collection or paperwork filing. Signature verification must occur within 30 days of submission, with preliminary counts provided within 15 days. Candidates may submit supplemental signatures to cure deficiencies.

States must treat independent and minor party candidates identically to major party candidates regarding ballot position (determined by random selection or rotation), ballot formatting, access to voter lists, participation in voter guides and candidate forums, and all other election administration aspects.

Write-in candidates are permitted for all federal offices provided they file a declaration of candidacy at least 30 days before the election.

### Enforcement and Effective Date

Any candidate denied ballot access in violation of Title I may bring civil action in federal district court, with expedited review given the time-sensitive nature of ballot access disputes. The Federal Election Commission receives enforcement authority and must promulgate implementing regulations within 180 days of enactment.

Title I takes effect at the First CMA Election, launching simultaneously with party recognition, House expansion, and multi-member districts as part of the integrated reform package.

---

## IV. TITLE II: FEDERAL POLITICAL PARTY RECOGNITION

Title II establishes federal standards for recognizing political parties and implements Joint Endorsement Lists, allowing multiple parties to formally endorse the same candidate on federal ballots. This system differs from traditional fusion voting where candidates appear multiple times on ballots with vote aggregation -- under Joint Endorsement Lists, candidates appear once with up to three party endorsements displayed.

### Party Recognition Standards

To qualify as a federally recognized political party, organizations must meet one of two criteria:

**Electoral Performance Standard**: The party's candidate for President, Senate, or House received at least 5% of votes in the most recent federal election in at least 15 states.

**Membership Standard**: The party demonstrates at least 100,000 registered members nationally, members in at least 25 states, no single state comprising more than 25% of total membership, formal organizational structure including bylaws and elected leadership, democratic internal decision-making processes, and basic financial transparency with annual FEC reporting.

Recognized parties maintain status by meeting either standard in each four-year cycle, filing annual reports documenting organizational structure and finances, maintaining democratic endorsement procedures, and endorsing at least one federal candidate every four years.

### Joint Endorsement Lists

Federally recognized parties may endorse candidates who accept their endorsement. Endorsed candidates appear on ballots with party designations clearly displayed. Candidates may receive up to three party endorsements, displayed in order chosen by the candidate.

Ballot format shows: "Candidate Name (Party A / Party B / Party C)" or equivalent clear display of multiple endorsements.

Parties retain full autonomy in their endorsement processes, which may include conventions, committee decisions, primaries, or other methods consistent with party bylaws. Crucially, parties may endorse candidates who also receive endorsements from other parties -- no party may prohibit endorsed candidates from accepting additional endorsements.

### Implementation

The FEC must promulgate implementing regulations within 180 days of enactment, covering party registration procedures, membership verification standards, electoral performance calculation methods, ballot display technical standards, and enforcement procedures.

Title II takes effect at the First CMA Election, launching simultaneously with ballot access standardization, House expansion, and multi-member districts.

---

## V. TITLE III: HOUSE MEMBERSHIP EXPANSION

Title III expands House membership from 435 to approximately 720 members over approximately 14 years, addressing the representation crisis created by population growth without corresponding House expansion since 1913. Current representation ratio stands at approximately 760,000 constituents per Representative -- six to seven times larger than peer democracies and compared to the founding era's ratio around 30,000:1.

### Accelerated Expansion Structure

**Initial Expansion (First CMA Election)**: House expands to 510 members (+75 seats), improving representation ratio to approximately 657,000:1. This initial expansion launches simultaneously with STAR voting and multi-member districts, ensuring the new seats are filled through the new electoral system rather than replicated dysfunction.

**Biennial Increases**: Beginning with the second Congress elected after initial expansion, House membership increases by 35 seats each Congress. This incremental approach sounds like routine institutional housekeeping rather than revolutionary transformation.

**Termination at Cube Root**: Biennial increases continue until House size equals or exceeds the cube root of the resident population of the United States as determined by the most recent decennial census. Based on current population projections, this occurs at approximately 720 members, roughly 14 years after enactment.

**Post-Stabilization Adjustment**: After biennial increases terminate, House size adjusts only once per decennial census, sized at the integer nearest to the cube root of the resident population.

### Projected Timeline

| Years After Enactment | House Size | Representation Ratio |
|----------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| ~2-3 (First CMA Election) | 510 | ~657,000:1 |
| ~4-5 | 545 | ~615,000:1 |
| ~6-7 | 580 | ~578,000:1 |
| ~8-9 | 615 | ~545,000:1 |
| ~10-11 | 650 | ~515,000:1 |
| ~12-13 | 685 | ~489,000:1 |
| ~14-15 | 720 | ~465,000:1 |
| Stabilization | ~720 | ~450,000:1 |

### Apportionment and Infrastructure

The Clerk of the House uses population data from the most recently completed decennial census to calculate House size according to the applicable formula, apportions seats among states using the method of equal proportions, and announces apportionment at least 12 months before each expansion. Each state receives at least one Representative as constitutionally required.

House expansion timing operates independently of decennial census timing. Apportionment always uses the most recent census data available, but expansions occur on the schedule established in Title III regardless of when censuses are conducted.

The Architect of the Capitol must develop plans for House Chamber expansion, additional office space, and technology infrastructure within 12 months of enactment. Congress appropriates funds for infrastructure improvements to be completed at least 12 months before initial expansion. GAO and CBO jointly prepare comprehensive reports analyzing facility requirements, technology needs, staff expansion costs, and budget impacts within 180 days of enactment.

### Enhanced Resources

Upon initial House expansion, each Representative's Member Representational Allowance (MRA) increases by 35% above pre-expansion levels, adjusted annually for inflation. MRA amounts receive review and adjustment at subsequent expansion milestones to ensure adequate resources relative to district size.

States redistrict following each expansion to accommodate increased representation, using the most recent census data and applying Title IV standards for multi-member districts where applicable.

---

## VI. TITLE IV: MULTI-MEMBER DISTRICTS AND STAR-PR

Title IV transitions congressional districts from single-member to multi-member configuration using proportional representation to eliminate geometric distortions inherent in winner-take-all systems. Single-member districts combined with plurality voting create mathematical distortions regardless of who draws the lines: 51% of votes yields 100% of representation in that district, like-minded voters clustering creates outcomes determined by boundaries rather than preferences, and redistricting disputes arise every census cycle.

### Historical and Constitutional Context

Multi-member congressional districts were standard American practice from 1789 through 1967. The 1967 federal mandate for single-member districts was statutory choice, not constitutional requirement. The Supreme Court explicitly validated multi-member districts in Whitcomb v. Chavis (1971) and White v. Regester (1973). Title IV reinstates historical practice while adding modern proportional allocation methods.

### Gradual Phase-In

Multi-member districts implement over five election cycles beginning with Transition Cycle 1 (the First CMA Election):

- **Transition Cycle 1 (First CMA Election)**: States may elect up to 25% of Representatives from multi-member districts
- **Transition Cycle 2**: Up to 50%
- **Transition Cycle 3**: Up to 75%
- **Transition Cycle 4**: Up to 90%
- **Full Implementation** (Fifth election following Transition Cycle 1): 100% of Representatives elected from multi-member districts

During Transition Cycles 1-4, incumbent Representatives may choose to remain in current single-member districts if they continue to exist or compete in newly created multi-member districts. No incumbent faces mandatory participation in multi-member districts until Full Implementation.

### District Requirements

Multi-member congressional districts must elect between 3 and 7 Representatives per district, contain substantially equal population across districts within each state, comply with Voting Rights Act and one-person-one-vote requirements, maintain geographic contiguity, and respect county and municipal boundaries where practicable. Districts may not be drawn to favor or disfavor any political party or incumbent.

States with fewer than three Representatives total are exempt from multi-member requirements and continue using single-winner STAR voting.

### STAR Voting Method

All federal elections use STAR voting (Score Then Automatic Runoff): voters score each candidate from 0 to 5 stars, the system maximizes voter satisfaction while maintaining accountability, and the familiar interface eliminates spoiler effects while reducing strategic voting incentives.

**For single-winner contests** (President, Senate, House districts electing fewer than three Representatives, and primaries in single-member districts): voters score all candidates 0-5 stars, the two highest-scoring candidates advance to an automatic runoff, and the candidate preferred by more voters in the runoff wins.

**For multi-member House districts** electing three or more Representatives, STAR-PR (Score Then Automatic Runoff - Proportional Representation, also known as Allocated Score) is used: voters score all candidates 0-5 stars, total scores are calculated for each candidate, seats are allocated proportionally using quota calculations and sequential proportional approval logic to maximize voter satisfaction while ensuring proportionality. The system ensures that vote share translates directly to seat share within districts -- in a 5-seat district where Party A receives 60% support and Party B receives 40% support, the result approximates 3 seats for Party A and 2 seats for Party B.

### Unified Election Structure

The Act establishes single general elections as the universal standard for all federal offices:

**All Federal Elections:** Qualified candidates meeting Title I ballot access requirements appear directly on the general election ballot with party endorsements (Title II) and FCAO scores (Title V) displayed. States do not conduct primary elections for federal offices.

**Rationale:** STAR voting's scoring mechanism ensures winners have both high overall support and majority preference, eliminating the traditional justification for preliminary filtering through primaries. Single general elections maximize voter participation, eliminate party registration barriers, reduce administrative costs, and ensure consistency of voter experience regardless of state of residence.

**Party Autonomy:** Political parties retain full authority to conduct internal nomination processes -- caucuses, conventions, advisory polls -- at their own expense and independent of state election infrastructure. Joint Endorsement Lists provide a streamlined mechanism for parties to signal preferred candidates to voters.

### Implementation Support

The FEC must publish detailed technical specifications for STAR voting and STAR-PR implementation within 12 months of enactment, covering ballot design standards, vote tabulation procedures, audit protocols, equipment certification requirements, and recount procedures.

The Act includes carefully crafted contingency procedures for genuine technical certification obstacles, allowing temporary use of Approval Voting with Sequential Proportional Approval Voting (SPAV) tabulation, but only upon FEC certification of objective technical barriers beyond state control. Contingency provisions do not excuse states from implementing multi-member districts as required and terminate automatically once compliant voting systems are available.

---

## VII. TITLE V: NON-QUALIFYING FEDERAL OFFICE EXAMINATIONS

Title V establishes the Federal Candidate Assessment Office (FCAO) as a permanent independent agency responsible for administering standardized competency examinations for all federal candidates. Examination results are displayed on ballots to provide voters with objective information about candidate knowledge and competence. Critically, examinations are non-qualifying: no minimum score is required for ballot access, and the only consequence of examination performance is transparency.

### The Non-Qualifying Principle

FCAO examinations provide information, not gatekeeping. Candidates cannot be excluded from ballots based on scores, voters receive complete freedom to value or disregard scores according to their preferences, transparency regarding candidate knowledge serves democratic information function without restricting democratic choice, and market dynamics create incentives for improvement as candidates compete to demonstrate superior competence.

The Act includes multiple structural protections for the non-qualifying principle:

- Inviolable transparency mandate explicitly prohibits minimum score requirements
- Highest score reporting obligation encourages competitive improvement
- Automatic invalidity of any state or federal attempt to create qualification systems
- Mandatory preliminary injunctions for violations
- Congressional enforcement authority with both civil and criminal penalties

This framework makes the non-qualifying principle essentially irrevocable within the statute's operation.

### FCAO Agency Structure

FCAO is established as an independent agency following the Federal Reserve and SEC model, designed for political resilience and institutional durability:

**Governance**: Nine-member Professional Standards Commission governs FCAO, with multi-branch appointments (three by President with Senate confirmation, two by Chief Justice, two by House Speaker, two by Senate Majority Leader). Staggered six-year terms prevent single-faction control. Commission members must possess demonstrated expertise in psychometrics, educational assessment, federal government operations, or related fields. At least three members must hold credentials in psychometrics or educational measurement to ensure rigorous standards. No more than five commissioners may belong to the same political party.

**Removal Protections**: Commissioners may only be removed for cause by supermajority vote (6 of 9 commissioners), requiring bipartisan consensus for removal and insulating commissioners from political pressure.

**Independent Funding**: FCAO operates through examination fees paid by candidates rather than Congressional appropriations, eliminating leverage points for political interference with agency operations.

**Professional Expertise Requirements**: The Commission must retain external psychometric consultants for examination development, validation studies, and quality assurance. Item response theory analysis ensures examination reliability and validity. Regular content reviews maintain relevance to federal office responsibilities.

### Examination Requirements

All candidates for federal office must complete examinations appropriate to their office at least 60 days before the election. Examinations cover constitutional structure and principles, federal legislative or executive processes, American history and government, basic economics and public policy, and current events and policy issues.

Examinations use multiple-choice, short answer, and essay formats, are professionally developed using item response theory and psychometric validation, contain 100-150 questions, require 2-3 hours to complete, and are offered at least quarterly in every state. Scores are reported on a standardized 200-800 scale similar to SAT scoring, providing clear comparative information without arbitrary pass/fail thresholds.

Candidates may retake examinations without limit, with only the highest score reported on ballots and in official materials. This encourages improvement and rewards preparation rather than penalizing early attempts. Recertification is required every six years to maintain relevance.

### Ballot Disclosure

States must display FCAO scores prominently on all official ballots immediately adjacent to candidate names, using consistent formatting across all races. Scores appear as "FCAO Score: XXX" in clear, readable type. Preliminary reports, absentee ballots, and sample ballots must include scores. Voter education materials must explain the non-qualifying nature and purpose of scores.

### Decoupled Timeline

Title V takes effect at the Second CMA Election rather than the First CMA Election. This decoupling provides adequate runway for FCAO to complete exam development, pilot testing, validation, and certification -- a process requiring 36-42 months for high-stakes federal examinations.

**Development Deadline**: FCAO must complete development, pilot testing, validation, and certification of all examinations no later than 18 months before the Second CMA Election.

**Administration Deadline**: FCAO must make examinations available for administration to candidates no later than 12 months before the Second CMA Election, providing sufficient testing windows for fair access and timely score reporting.

**First CMA Election Exemption**: No candidate is required to complete an FCAO examination for the First CMA Election. Ballots for the First CMA Election do not include FCAO score designations.

### Enforcement

Any candidate denied ballot access for refusing examination or failing to achieve minimum scores may bring suit in federal court with mandatory preliminary injunctions. The examination requirement itself stands, but any attempt to create qualification systems triggers automatic invalidity. Courts receive expedited review authority given time-sensitive election administration requirements. Attorney General and state attorneys general have independent enforcement authority.

## VIII. TITLE VI: TRANSITION, COMPENSATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION

Title VI addresses the fundamental political economy challenge facing electoral reforms: incumbents must vote for changes that may reduce their individual advantages. The title provides immediate compensation and capacity improvements that take effect upon enactment, before any electoral reforms are implemented.

### Immediate Provisions (Taking Effect upon Enactment)

**Phased Salary Increases**: Member compensation increases gradually over five years following enactment:

- House: $174,000 (current) rising to $250,000 (Year 5)
- Senate: $174,000 (current) rising to $300,000 (Year 5)

The Senate differential reflects distinct constitutional responsibilities (advice and consent on appointments and treaties), statewide rather than district constituencies, and six-year terms requiring longer-term perspective. Phased implementation provides gradual budget adjustment rather than sudden increase.

**Enhanced Pension Formula**: The Act modifies federal pension calculations to provide 2.5% of high-three average salary per year of service (increased from 1.7% for first 20 years under current law), vesting after five years of service, and includes service for pension calculations even if members leave before retirement age. This addresses the reality that post-Congress career opportunities have diminished as ethical standards appropriately restrict lobbying, making defined-benefit pension more important for long-term financial security.

**Professional Development Allowance**: Members receive annual professional development allowances equal to 5% of base salary ($12,500 for House, $15,000 for Senate at full compensation levels). This covers conferences, continuing education coursework, policy research and analysis, technical training, language instruction, and other qualifying professional development activities. Ethics office reporting ensures appropriate use and accountability.

While private sector executive professional development typically represents 3-4% of compensation, this percentage yields $15,000-20,000 annually for executives earning $500,000-600,000. To provide equivalent professional development resources at congressional compensation levels, a 5% allocation is necessary to reach comparable absolute dollar amounts for elite executive education programs.

**Senate Appointment Authority**: For Senate vacancies in states requiring gubernatorial appointment, if the governor fails to make an appointment within 120 days, the secretary of state must hold a special election within 90 days. This prevents extended vacancies from gubernatorial inaction while respecting state authority over the appointment mechanism.

**State Election Administration Funding**: Substantial federal grants support state implementation of CMA requirements: $500 million in the first fiscal year, $300 million annually for the subsequent four years, and $150 million annually thereafter (adjusted for inflation). Grants offset state costs for voting equipment acquisition, ballot design systems, election official training, voter education campaigns, and administrative upgrades. Allocation formula provides 50% by equal distribution among states, 25% by proportion of registered voters, and 25% by implementation complexity.

### Conditional Provisions (Taking Effect upon Initial Expansion)

**Enhanced Member Representational Allowance**: Upon initial House expansion (First CMA Election), each Representative's MRA increases by 35% above pre-expansion levels, adjusted annually for inflation. This addresses increased demands from expanded institutional operations.

**Transition Protection for Incumbents**: During multi-member district Transition Cycles 1-4, incumbents may choose to remain in single-member districts if they continue to exist or compete in multi-member districts. No incumbent is required to participate in multi-member districts until Full Implementation. This provides transition flexibility allowing incumbents to adjust to new systems at their own pace or retire under systems they understand.

**Public Matching Funds**: Beginning with Transition Cycle 1, candidates for House and Senate may qualify for public matching funds providing 6:1 match for individual donations under $200 from registered voters in their state or district. Qualifying requires collecting threshold amounts from minimum numbers of individual donors (specific amounts determined by FEC based on district size). Participating candidates must agree to voluntary spending limits and enhanced disclosure requirements.

### Severability and Protection

All provisions in Title VI include strong severability protection. If any provision is held invalid by courts, all other provisions remain in full force. Specifically, compensation mechanisms that have taken effect remain in force even if corresponding reform provisions are invalidated. This ensures that if courts strike down particular electoral reforms, members do not retroactively lose compensation improvements.

---

## IX. TITLE VII: ENFORCEMENT, REPORTING, AND OVERSIGHT

Title VII establishes comprehensive mechanisms for implementing, enforcing, monitoring, and supporting the Act's various provisions.

### Federal Election Commission Authority

The FEC must promulgate implementing regulations within 18 months of enactment covering technical standards for ballot design, party recognition procedures, STAR-PR implementation specifications, public matching fund administration, compliance monitoring, and reporting requirements. The Commission provides technical assistance to states including model legislation, administrative procedures, and best practices.

The FEC receives enforcement authority to investigate complaints and bring actions against states systematically violating CMA requirements. Civil penalties may apply for violations, with enhanced penalties for willful or repeated violations.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Congressional Budget Office prepares comprehensive cost estimates within 180 days of enactment covering direct costs of all provisions, offsetting savings from efficiency gains, long-term fiscal impacts over 30-year horizon, comparison to alternative scenarios, and economic growth effects.

### Reporting Requirements

Multiple entities provide regular reports to Congress:

**FEC Annual Reports**: Implementation progress across all titles, state compliance with federal standards, litigation and enforcement actions, party recognition and ballot endorsement data, examination administration and score distributions, and recommendations for adjustments or improvements.

**GAO Quinquennial Reviews**: Every five years following enactment, GAO conducts comprehensive assessments of all CMA provisions covering implementation effectiveness and state compliance, impact on representation quality, electoral competition metrics, voter satisfaction and turnout, institutional capacity and functionality, and recommendations for adjustments.

All reports are made publicly available online within 30 days of submission to Congress, ensuring transparency and accountability.

### Judicial Review and Private Right of Action

Federal district courts receive original jurisdiction over cases arising under the Act, with appeals to appropriate circuit courts and Supreme Court. Courts must expedite cases challenging implementation, particularly those filed in election years potentially affecting upcoming elections.

Standing to sue belongs to qualified voters in affected jurisdictions, candidates for federal office, federally recognized political parties, state or local governments challenging federal standards, and the Attorney General or state attorneys general. Prevailing parties receive reasonable attorney's fees and costs.

### Transition Support Office

The Election Assistance Commission establishes a Transition Support Office to coordinate federal assistance to states, provide technical guidance on STAR-PR, redistricting, and ballot design, develop best practices and model procedures, facilitate information sharing among states, administer grant programs, and monitor implementation timelines and milestones.

The Office receives adequate staffing, resources, and technology to fulfill its mission, with capacity scaling with implementation phases. The Office remains operational until full implementation is complete, after which its functions may be absorbed into regular EAC operations.

### Protection Against Repeal or Defunding

Once any Title VI compensation mechanism takes effect, it may not be reduced, eliminated, or defunded except by three-fifths vote of both House and Senate. This supermajority requirement provides political entrenchment for compensation improvements, making reversal difficult even if future Congresses oppose electoral reforms.

Severability protection ensures that if any provision is held invalid, all compensation mechanisms that have taken effect remain in force regardless of whether corresponding reform provisions remain operational.

Anti-retaliation provisions protect members from facing reduction in salary, benefits, committee assignments, or other privileges based on their vote for or against the Act.

---

## X. TITLE VIII: GENERAL PROVISIONS

Title VIII addresses standard legislative matters including severability, constitutional supremacy, rules of construction, effective dates, and definitions.

### Severability

If any provision of the Act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid by courts, the remainder of the Act and application to other persons or circumstances remain unaffected. Specifically, if any reform title (Titles I-V) is held invalid, all Title VI compensation mechanisms that have taken effect remain in force, other valid reform titles continue operating, and Title VII enforcement provisions continue applying to all valid provisions.

This ensures that judicial invalidation of particular provisions does not destroy the entire integrated reform structure.

### Constitutional Supremacy

Nothing in the Act supersedes or modifies any provision of the Constitution. To the extent any provision conflicts with constitutional requirements, the Constitution prevails. This acknowledges judicial supremacy in constitutional interpretation while maintaining statutory integrity where constitutionally permissible.

### Rules of Construction

The Act shall be liberally construed to achieve its purposes of restoring competitive, representative democracy. Nothing grants Congress authority it does not otherwise possess under the Constitution. Except where expressly preempted by the Act, states retain authority over election administration, ballot design, and other matters within their traditional purview.

### Definitions

The Act defines key terms:

**First CMA Election**: The second regularly scheduled general election for Congress occurring after enactment, except that if such second election occurs less than eighteen (18) months after enactment, the First CMA Election shall instead be the third regularly scheduled general election for Congress occurring after enactment.

**Second CMA Election**: The first regularly scheduled general election for Congress occurring after the First CMA Election.

**Transition Cycle 1**: The First CMA Election (when Title IV multi-member district phase-in begins at 25%).

**Full Implementation**: The fifth congressional election following Transition Cycle 1 (when Title IV multi-member district phase-in completes at 100%).

### Effective Date Structure

The Act uses a tiered effective date structure:

**Tier 1 -- Immediate upon enactment**: Titles VI, VII, and VIII take effect on the date of enactment, providing compensation benefits, enforcement authority, and administrative framework.

**Tier 2 -- First CMA Election**: Titles I, II, III, and IV take effect at the First CMA Election, launching ballot access, party recognition, House expansion, and multi-member districts simultaneously as an integrated system.

**Tier 3 -- Second CMA Election**: Title V takes effect at the Second CMA Election, providing adequate runway for FCAO exam development and validation.

For House expansion and reapportionment, expansion timing operates independently of decennial census timing -- apportionment among states uses population data from the most recently completed decennial census, but expansions occur on the biennial schedule regardless of when censuses are conducted.

### Short Title

The Act may be cited as the "Congressional Modernization Act" or "CMA."

## XI. INTEGRATION AND SYNERGIES

The CMA's eight titles function as an integrated system where each component reinforces the others:

**Uniform ballot access standards** (Title I) enable meaningful competition by reducing arbitrary barriers that advantage incumbents and wealthy candidates.

**Federal party recognition and Joint Endorsement Lists** (Title II) provide infrastructure for multiparty competition without requiring voters to abandon major parties, allowing coalition building and reducing polarization.

**House membership expansion** (Title III) creates institutional capacity for proportional representation, improves constituent services through better representation ratios, and dilutes individual member obstruction power toward founders' design.

**Multi-member districts with STAR-PR** (Title IV) eliminate geometric distortions from winner-take-all systems, ensuring votes translate to proportional representation regardless of which party controls redistricting, and make boundary manipulation mathematically ineffective.

**FCAO examinations** (Title V) provide voters with objective competency information while maintaining complete democratic choice through the non-qualifying principle, creating market incentives for candidate preparation without gatekeeping.

**Compensation and transition mechanisms** (Title VI) align incumbent incentives with reform objectives by providing immediate universal benefits while reforms launch at the First CMA Election, transforming electoral reform from political suicide into rational self-interest.

**Enforcement and oversight** (Title VII) ensure effective implementation through federal support, regular assessment, and clear judicial review procedures.

**General provisions** (Title VIII) provide standard legislative infrastructure ensuring legal coherence and judicial manageability.

These components address root causes rather than symptoms. While campaign finance reform, redistricting commissions, and term limits treat symptoms of uncompetitive elections, the CMA restructures fundamental electoral architecture to restore competition and proportional representation.

The Act implements STAR voting universally for all federal elections -- both single-winner contests (President, Senate, single-member House districts) and proportional contests (multi-member House districts via STAR-PR). This creates consistent voter experience across all federal races, enables institutional learning and expertise development in election administration, and simplifies voter education by maintaining the same ballot marking method regardless of office or district structure.

**The simultaneous integrated launch principle** ensures that STAR voting, multi-member districts, and House expansion debut together at the First CMA Election. This produces "the new Congress" rather than "more of the old Congress" -- preventing a scenario where expanded House seats are filled through the old dysfunctional system before electoral reforms take effect.

---

## XII. POLITICAL VIABILITY ARCHITECTURE

The CMA's structure directly addresses the central political economy challenge facing electoral reforms: incumbents must vote for changes that may reduce their individual advantages. This "turkey voting for Thanksgiving" problem has historically made comprehensive electoral reform politically infeasible.

The Act resolves this through several mechanisms:

**Immediate universal benefits**: All Title VI compensation provisions take effect upon enactment regardless of party affiliation, providing salary increases, enhanced pensions, and professional development allowances. These benefits arrive immediately while electoral reforms launch at the First CMA Election.

**Reform on a human timescale**: Electoral reforms and House expansion achieve cube root compliance within approximately 14 years -- three presidential terms. Members who vote for CMA will see results during their careers. Voters will experience tangible improvements in representation quality within a single political generation.

**Transition protections**: Incumbents may remain in single-member districts during multi-member district Transition Cycles 1-4, adjusting at their own pace or retiring under systems they understand.

**Senate protections**: The Senate receives compensation differential recognizing distinct constitutional responsibilities, protection of statewide constituency service needs, streamlined appointment authority preventing extended vacancies, and proportional representation in House not affecting Senate operations. This ensures bicameral support by addressing Senate-specific concerns.

**Durable provisions**: Supermajority requirement (three-fifths of both chambers) for reducing or eliminating Title VI compensation mechanisms provides political entrenchment. Strong severability ensures compensation improvements survive even if courts invalidate particular reforms.

This architecture transforms democratic reform from political suicide into rational self-interest, making passage politically feasible while maintaining policy integrity. Members receive substantial, immediate, durable benefits while accepting integrated electoral reforms that launch at the First CMA Election and achieve full implementation within a political generation.

## XIII. CONSTITUTIONAL AND HISTORICAL FOUNDATIONS

The CMA rests on solid constitutional authority and extensive American historical precedent:

**Elections Clause Authority** (Article I, Section 4, Clause 1): Congress possesses explicit constitutional authority to regulate the "Times, Places and Manner" of federal elections. The Supreme Court has consistently recognized this as plenary power. Titles I, II, IV, and V exercise this clear constitutional authority.

**House Size and Composition** (Article I, Section 2): The Constitution provides that Representatives shall be apportioned among states according to population but does not fix House size. Congress has adjusted House membership multiple times throughout history. The current 435-member cap is statutory, not constitutional. Title III exercises clear constitutional authority to expand House membership.

**Multi-Member Districts**: Multi-member congressional districts were standard American practice from 1789 through 1967 -- 178 years of precedent. The 1967 federal mandate for single-member districts was statutory choice, not constitutional requirement. The Supreme Court explicitly validated multi-member districts in Whitcomb v. Chavis (1971) and White v. Regester (1973). Title IV reinstates proven historical practice.

**Compensation Authority** (Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 and Twenty-Seventh Amendment): Congress possesses constitutional authority to determine its own compensation, subject to the Twenty-Seventh Amendment's requirement that changes not take effect until after an intervening election. Title VI's phased salary increases comply with this requirement.

The Act's reforms draw from American historical practice rather than importing foreign models. Joint Endorsement Lists build on American fusion voting tradition. Multi-member districts restore pre-1967 American practice. House expansion continues the founders' expectation that representation would grow with population. STAR voting applies modern technology to vote aggregation but maintains direct candidate-centered voting familiar to American voters.

## XIV. CONCLUSION

The Congressional Modernization Act provides comprehensive reform architecture addressing the fundamental maintenance needs of American representative democracy. It modernizes electoral infrastructure, expands institutional capacity, implements proportional representation, provides voter information systems, and aligns incentive structures to enable effective 21st-century governance.

The legislation's integrated structure ensures that each component reinforces the others while the simultaneous integrated launch at the First CMA Election prevents scenarios where expansion occurs before electoral reform. The accelerated timeline delivers cube root compliance within approximately 14 years, ensuring that reform occurs on a human timescale.

Most significantly, the Act resolves the central political economy challenge facing electoral reforms by providing substantial immediate benefits to all current members upon enactment while launching integrated structural changes at the First CMA Election. This transforms democratic reform from political suicide into rational self-interest, making passage politically feasible while maintaining comprehensive policy integrity.

The result is legislation that addresses root causes of electoral dysfunction through structural reform rather than treating symptoms through piecemeal adjustments, restores American historical practices rather than importing foreign models, exercises clear constitutional authority, implements on a human timescale to deliver results within a political generation, and creates political viability through intelligent incentive alignment.
