# THE CONGRESSIONAL MODERNIZATION ACT (CMA)

## A Framework for Stable, Effective, and Representative Governance

**Equipping Congress for the 21st Century**

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the "Congressional Modernization Act" or "CMA."

---

## SECTION 2. FINDINGS

### (a) Constitutional Authority

Congress finds that:

1. The Constitution grants Congress authority under the Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4, Clause 1) to regulate the "times, places and manner of holding elections" for federal office.

2. Congress possesses clear constitutional authority to adjust House size through regular legislation under Article I, Section 2, requiring no constitutional amendment.

3. The Constitution anticipates and accommodates changes in representation and electoral procedures. The Framers deliberately created a flexible framework allowing Congress to adapt democratic structures to changing circumstances.

### (b) Current Electoral Dysfunction

Congress finds that:

4. The American electoral system has produced a Congress unable to address the nation's most pressing challenges. Partisan polarization, legislative gridlock, and declining public trust reflect fundamental structural problems, not merely poor leadership or insufficient civic engagement.

5. The current winner-take-all, single-member district system creates incentives for partisan gerrymandering, safe seats that insulate incumbents from general election competition, and ideological extremism that makes compromise politically dangerous.

6. Only 15-30 House districts (3-7% of all seats) are genuinely competitive under current electoral structures. This means approximately 93-97% of House elections are effectively decided in low-turnout partisan primaries rather than general elections, undermining democratic accountability to the broader electorate.

7. Voters in single-member districts who support losing candidates receive zero representation of their views. In a 435-seat House elected by winner-take-all rules, millions of voters in each election cycle cast ballots that have no influence on who represents them, creating systematic underrepresentation of political minorities in every district and state.

8. House districts now represent an average of 770,000 constituents, making meaningful constituent services impossible and creating barriers between representatives and the people they serve. The original ratio (approximately 30,000:1) was designed to ensure representatives maintained close connections to constituents and could provide meaningful responsiveness to local concerns.

9. Congress operates with infrastructure designed for 4 million Americans now serving 335 million -- an 84-fold population increase without proportional expansion in representative capacity. This structural mismatch between institutional capacity and governing demands has degraded Congress's ability to perform its constitutional functions effectively.

### (c) Need for Comprehensive Reform

Congress finds that:

10. Piecemeal reforms addressing individual symptoms of electoral dysfunction -- such as redistricting commissions, term limits, or campaign finance restrictions -- cannot solve structural problems requiring systematic electoral architecture changes.

11. Primary elections in single-member winner-take-all districts create incentives for ideological extremism, as candidates must appeal to partisan base voters rather than median general election voters. This dynamic has accelerated partisan polarization and made cross-party coalition-building politically dangerous for incumbents facing primary challenges.

12. Proportional representation through multi-member districts enables multiple political perspectives to win seats in proportion to voter support, creating incentives for coalition-building and compromise while maintaining local accountability through district-based representation.

13. STAR (Score Then Automatic Runoff) voting provides superior preference expression compared to plurality or ranked-choice voting, enabling voters to express nuanced opinions about multiple candidates while maintaining simplicity and avoiding vote-splitting problems that plague other systems.

14. The scale of representation deficiency in the current 435-member House requires timely correction. At present ratios exceeding 760,000 constituents per Representative -- six to seven times larger than peer democracies -- meaningful constituent service and legislative responsiveness have become structurally impossible. A modernized House sized according to the cube root rule, reaching approximately 700 to 720 members under Census Bureau population projections, restores manageable district populations and strengthens legislative effectiveness. An initial expansion to 510 members followed by predictable biennial increases of 35 seats achieves cube root compliance within approximately 14 years -- three presidential terms -- enabling the Nation to realize the democratic benefits of proportional representation and multi-member districts within a single political generation. This accelerated timeline ensures that members who enact these reforms will see their results, voters will experience tangible improvements in representation quality, and institutional modernization proceeds on a human timescale rather than deferring reform impacts to the distant future.

15. State legislatures and city councils successfully operate with proportional representation systems and larger memberships, demonstrating that these reforms are practical, effective, and consistent with American governance traditions.

### (d) Proportional Representation Benefits

Congress finds that:

16. Multi-member districts with proportional representation reduce gerrymandering incentives, as manipulating district boundaries cannot eliminate proportional representation of political minorities. While district boundaries still matter, the winner-take-all dynamic that makes gerrymandering so powerful disappears under proportional systems.

17. Proportional representation creates incentives for political parties to appeal to broader coalitions and for candidates to build cross-partisan support, as winning seats requires demonstrating appeal beyond narrow partisan bases.

18. Multi-member districts enable voters to choose among multiple candidates from the same party or political tradition, providing meaningful choice even in areas dominated by one party. This intra-party competition creates accountability and quality control without requiring voters to support parties they oppose.

19. Increasing House size makes gerrymandering mathematically more difficult, as creating manipulated districts becomes exponentially more complex with more districts and smaller district populations.

20. Countries using proportional representation systems demonstrate higher voter satisfaction, broader representation of diverse viewpoints, and greater incentives for inter-party cooperation and coalition government formation.

### (e) Integrated Reform Necessity

Congress finds that:

21. Electoral reforms create transitional challenges for incumbents whose careers were built under winner-take-all rules. Providing reasonable transition protections and compensation adjustments aligns incumbent incentives with reform goals and removes barriers to passage.

22. The reforms in this Act are designed as an integrated system where each component reinforces the others. Ballot access reform (Title I) enables party competition. Party recognition standards (Title II) provide structure for Joint Endorsement Lists. House expansion (Title III) creates seats for proportional representation. Multi-member districts with STAR-PR (Title IV) operationalize proportionality. Non-qualifying federal office examinations (Title V) provide transparency without creating barriers. Compensation, transition, and implementation mechanisms (Title VI) align incentives to make passage politically viable. Enforcement and reporting requirements (Title VII) ensure implementation. General provisions (Title VIII) resolve technical implementation details.

23. These reforms address root causes rather than symptoms. While campaign finance reform, redistricting commissions, and term limits treat symptoms of uncompetitive elections, this Act restructures the fundamental electoral architecture to restore competition and proportional representation.

24. Implementing STAR voting universally for all federal elections -- both for single-winner contests (President, Senate, single-member House districts) and proportional contests (multi-member House districts via STAR-PR) -- creates consistent voter experience across all federal races, enables institutional learning and expertise development in election administration, and simplifies voter education by maintaining the same ballot marking method (score-then-preference) regardless of office or district structure.

**END OF TITLE II**


### Section 301. House Expansion Schedule

#### (a) Initial Expansion

Beginning with the First CMA Election, the House of Representatives shall consist of five hundred ten (510) members.

#### (b) Biennial Increases

Beginning with the second Congress elected after the initial expansion described in subsection (a), and at the beginning of each subsequent Congress, the total membership of the House of Representatives shall increase by thirty-five (35) seats.

#### (c) Termination of Biennial Increases

Biennial increases under subsection (b) shall continue until the total number of Representatives equals or exceeds the cube root of the resident population of the United States, as determined by the most recent decennial census. Once this threshold is reached, further changes in House size shall occur only pursuant to subsection (d).

#### (d) Post-Stabilization Adjustment Rule

After biennial increases terminate under subsection (c), the House shall thereafter be sized at the integer nearest to the cube root of the resident population of the United States as measured by each decennial census, rounding up in cases of exact halves. House size shall be adjusted only once per decennial cycle pursuant to this formula.

#### (e) Apportionment Procedure

For each expansion under this section, the Clerk of the House shall:

1. Use population data from the most recently completed decennial census;
2. Calculate updated House size pursuant to subsections (a) through (d);
3. Apportion such seats among the states using the Method of Equal Proportions; and
4. Publish the apportionment at least twelve (12) months before the applicable election.

#### (f) Minimum State Representation

Each state shall receive at least one Representative, as required by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution.

#### (g) Independence from Census Timing

House expansion timing under this section operates independently of decennial census timing. Apportionment shall always use the most recent census data available, but expansions occur on the schedule established in this section regardless of when censuses are conducted.

### Section 302. Infrastructure Preparation

#### (a) Architect of the Capitol Responsibilities

The Architect of the Capitol shall, within 12 months of enactment:

1. Develop plans for House Chamber expansion to accommodate 750 members;
2. Design additional office space for new members and staff;
3. Plan technology infrastructure for expanded membership;
4. Estimate capital improvement costs; and
5. Present plans to House Administration Committee for approval.

#### (b) Infrastructure Timeline

Congress shall appropriate necessary funds for infrastructure improvements to be completed:

1. At least 12 months before the First CMA Election (510-member capacity);
2. Incrementally thereafter as biennial expansions require additional capacity; and
3. Fully completed to cube root capacity (approximately 720 members) within 14 years of enactment.

#### (c) GAO and CBO Studies

Within 180 days of enactment, the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office shall jointly prepare comprehensive reports analyzing:

1. Facility requirements for expanded House membership;
2. Technology and security infrastructure needs;
3. Staff expansion requirements and costs;
4. Office space allocation strategies;
5. Budget impacts and cost projections; and
6. Administrative and operational adjustments required.

### Section 303. Member Representational Allowance

#### (a) Enhanced MRA

Upon the First CMA Election, each Representative's Member Representational Allowance (MRA) shall increase by 35% above the amount in effect immediately before the First CMA Election, adjusted annually for inflation thereafter.

#### (b) Subsequent Adjustments

MRA amounts shall be reviewed and adjusted as necessary with each biennial House expansion to ensure adequate resources relative to district size.

#### (c) Authorization

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as necessary to provide enhanced MRA as specified herein.

### Section 304. Redistricting Requirements

States shall redistrict following each House expansion to accommodate increased representation, using:

1. Population data from the most recent decennial census;
2. Standards established in Title IV for multi-member districts (if applicable); and
3. Traditional redistricting principles for single-member districts (if applicable).

### Section 305. Compliance and Oversight

#### (a) Department of Justice Review

The Department of Justice shall review state redistricting plans following each House expansion to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act and constitutional requirements.

---

**END OF TITLE III**


### Section 401. Single-Member District Mandate Repeal

The requirement in 2 U.S.C. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ 2c that Representatives be elected from single-member districts is hereby repealed. States shall elect Representatives from multi-member districts as provided in this Title.

### Section 402. Multi-Member District Implementation

#### (a) Gradual Phase-In Schedule

States shall transition to multi-member congressional districts according to the following schedule:

**Transition Cycle 1**: The First CMA Election

- States may elect up to 25% of Representatives from multi-member districts

**Transition Cycle 2**: Second congressional election following Transition Cycle 1

- States may elect up to 50% of Representatives from multi-member districts

**Transition Cycle 3**: Third congressional election following Transition Cycle 1

- States may elect up to 75% of Representatives from multi-member districts

**Transition Cycle 4**: Fourth congressional election following Transition Cycle 1

- States may elect up to 90% of Representatives from multi-member districts

**Full Implementation**: Fifth congressional election following Transition Cycle 1

- States shall elect 100% of Representatives from multi-member districts (except as provided in subsection (e))

#### (b) District Magnitude Requirements

Multi-member congressional districts shall:

1. Elect between 3 and 7 Representatives per district;
2. Contain substantially equal population across districts within each state;
3. Comply with Voting Rights Act and constitutional one-person-one-vote requirements;
4. Maintain geographic contiguity and, where practicable, respect county and municipal boundaries; and
5. Not be drawn to favor or disfavor any political party or incumbent.

#### (c) Incumbent Protection During Transition

During Transition Cycles 1-4, incumbent Representatives may choose to:

1. Remain in current single-member districts if they continue to exist; or
2. Compete in newly created multi-member districts.

No incumbent shall be required to compete in multi-member districts until Full Implementation.

#### (d) Limited Single-Member District Retention

Following Full Implementation, states may retain single-member districts only for:

1. Geographically isolated areas (e.g., Alaska's remote regions, Hawaii's islands) where multi-member districts would create unreasonable geographic burdens; or
2. States with fewer than three Representatives total.

Such exceptions require Department of Justice approval with demonstration that multi-member districts would substantially impair effective representation.

#### (e) Small State Application

States with fewer than three Representatives are exempt from multi-member district requirements and shall use single-winner STAR voting as specified in Section 404(e).

### Section 403. Districting Criteria

#### (a) Required Standards

States drawing multi-member congressional districts shall:

1. Ensure substantial population equality across districts;
2. Maintain Voting Rights Act compliance;
3. Preserve communities of interest where practicable;
4. Respect county and municipal boundaries where consistent with other requirements; and
5. Maintain geographic contiguity.

#### (b) Prohibited Criteria

States may not draw multi-member districts to:

1. Discriminate based on race, ethnicity, language minority status, or political party membership;
2. Dilute minority voting strength in violation of the Voting Rights Act; or
3. Favor or disfavor any political party or incumbent.

#### (c) Independent Redistricting Commissions

States are encouraged but not required to establish independent redistricting commissions. Redistricting procedures remain within state authority subject to federal standards.

### Section 404. STAR Voting Method

#### (a) Universal STAR Voting Requirement

All federal elections shall use STAR voting (Score Then Automatic Runoff):

1. Voters score each candidate from 0-5 stars;
2. System maximizes voter satisfaction while maintaining accountability;
3. Eliminates spoiler effects and reduces strategic voting incentives; and
4. Provides intuitive interface familiar from consumer rating systems.

This requirement applies to:

1. All House of Representatives elections;
2. All United States Senate elections; and
3. All Presidential elections.

#### (b) Implementation Timeline

STAR voting for all federal elections takes effect for the first federal elections held at least 24 months after enactment.

#### (c) Ballot Format

Ballots shall display all qualified candidates with scoring interface allowing voters to:

1. Score all candidates, some candidates, or no candidates;
2. Assign the same score to multiple candidates;
3. Leave candidates unscored (treated as 0 stars); and
4. View candidate party endorsements (Title II) and FCAO scores (Title V).

#### (d) Unified General Election Structure

For all federal elections, qualified candidates appear directly on the general election ballot without state-administered primary elections.

**(1) Single General Election Requirement**

All candidates meeting ballot access requirements (Title I) appear directly on the general election ballot, with party endorsements (Title II) and FCAO scores (Title V, beginning with the Second CMA Election) displayed.

This requirement applies uniformly to:

- All House of Representatives elections, regardless of district type;
- All United States Senate elections; and
- All Presidential elections.

States shall not conduct state-administered primary elections for federal offices.

**(2) Rationale**

STAR voting achieves optimal democratic outcomes when all qualified candidates appear on the general election ballot without pre-filtering through primaries. The scoring mechanism ensures winners have both high overall support and majority preference in the automatic runoff, eliminating the traditional justification for primary elections. Single general elections:

- Maximize voter participation (general elections consistently outperform primaries in turnout);
- Eliminate party registration barriers that exclude voters from meaningful participation;
- Reduce administrative costs and campaign cycle duration;
- Ensure consistency of voter experience across all federal elections regardless of state of residence;
- Allow STAR voting to perform its designed function of identifying broadly supported winners from any field size; and
- Eliminate state-by-state variation that creates confusion and unequal access to democratic participation.

**(3) Party Autonomy Preserved**

Political parties retain full autonomy to conduct internal candidate selection processes independent of state-administered elections. Parties may:

- Conduct internal nomination processes through caucuses, conventions, or party-controlled procedures;
- Hold advisory straw polls or preference votes among party members;
- Issue endorsements through Joint Endorsement Lists (Title II);
- Campaign for preferred candidates;
- Organize party infrastructure and recruit candidates; and
- Provide resources and support to preferred candidates.

Such party processes:

- Shall be funded entirely by the party conducting them;
- Shall not use state election infrastructure or personnel;
- Shall not restrict which candidates appear on the general election ballot; and
- Shall not affect candidate eligibility or ballot access under Title I.

**(4) Constitutional Rationale**

This unified general election structure:

- Exercises Elections Clause authority to regulate the "manner of holding elections" for federal office;
- Establishes uniform national standards for federal elections consistent with Congressional authority;
- Does not prohibit party activity but separates party processes from state-administered elections;
- Preserves party autonomy by permitting internal nomination processes at party expense;
- Ensures equal voter participation regardless of party affiliation or state of residence; and
- Advances legitimate governmental interests in administrative efficiency, voter participation, electoral consistency, and democratic integrity.

**(5) Implementation Timeline**

This subsection takes effect for the First CMA Election.

#### (e) Single-Winner STAR Tabulation

For elections with single winner:

**Step 1: Score Tabulation**

- Sum all scores received by each candidate
- Identify two candidates with highest total scores

**Step 2: Automatic Runoff**

- Compare two highest-scoring candidates
- On each ballot, candidate with higher score receives one vote
- Candidate receiving more votes in automatic runoff is elected

**Step 3: Tiebreaking**

- Ties resolved by random selection, public lot drawing, or other neutral method established by state law

This single-winner procedure applies to:

1. All Senate elections;
2. All Presidential elections;
3. House elections in single-member districts; and
4. House elections in districts electing one or two Representatives.

#### (f) Multi-Member District Election Procedures

Elections for House seats in multi-member districts follow the unified general election structure specified in subsection (d).

**(1) Direct General Election**

All candidates meeting ballot access requirements (Title I) appear directly on the general election ballot for multi-member district seats, with party endorsements (Title II) and FCAO scores (Title V, beginning with the Second CMA Election) displayed.

**(2) Rationale**

Multi-member districts using STAR-PR achieve optimal democratic outcomes when all qualified candidates appear on the general election ballot. Proportional allocation ensures diverse viewpoints receive representation proportional to voter support without requiring preliminary candidate field narrowing.

**(3) Implementation Timeline**

This subsection takes effect upon multi-member district implementation in each state according to Section 402(a) schedule.

#### (g) STAR-PR for Multi-Member House Districts

For House elections in multi-member districts electing three or more Representatives, STAR-PR (Score Then Automatic Runoff - Proportional Representation, also known as Allocated Score) shall be used:

**Step 1: Score Tabulation**

- Sum all scores received by each candidate
- Calculate total score for each candidate

**Step 2: Proportional Allocation**

- Determine quota: (Total valid ballots) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â· (Seats + 1)
- Candidates meeting or exceeding quota are elected
- Allocate seats using Sequential Proportional Approval Voting logic to maximize voter satisfaction while ensuring proportionality

**Step 3: Runoff Allocation**

- If seats remain after quota candidates elected, conduct automatic runoffs among remaining candidates
- Runoffs consider voter scores to allocate remaining seats to candidates with strongest remaining support

**Step 4: Tiebreaking**

- Ties resolved by random selection, public lot drawing, or other neutral method established by state law

This proportional procedure applies only to House elections in multi-member districts with three or more seats.

#### (h) Minimum Threshold for STAR-PR

Districts electing fewer than three Representatives shall use single-winner STAR voting (subsection (e)) rather than STAR-PR. STAR-PR shall only be used for House districts electing three or more Representatives simultaneously.

#### (i) FEC Certification and Technical Specifications

The Federal Election Commission shall, within 12 months of enactment, publish detailed technical specifications for:

1. Single-winner STAR voting implementation for general elections;
2. STAR-PR (Allocated Score) implementation for multi-member districts;
3. Ballot design standards for STAR voting interfaces;
4. Vote tabulation procedures and audit protocols;
5. Voting equipment certification requirements; and
6. Recount and tie-breaking procedures.

#### (j) Contingency Procedures for Certification Delays

**(1) Invocation Threshold**

Contingency procedures may be invoked only where STAR-PR implementation faces temporary, demonstrably objective technical certification obstacles preventing lawful election administration, as certified by the FEC following petition by the affected state.

For purposes of this subsection, "technical certification obstacles" means obstacles arising from:

- Voting equipment vendor inability to achieve federal certification standards despite documented good-faith efforts;
- Verification that no commercially available voting system meets federal STAR-PR specifications; or
- Other objective technical barriers beyond state control and not resulting from state action or inaction.

**(2) Limited Scope**

Contingency procedures:

- Apply only to STAR-PR for multi-member districts, not to single-winner STAR voting;
- Do not excuse states from implementing multi-member districts as required by Section 402;
- Provide temporary alternative tabulation methods only, not permanent substitutes; and
- Terminate automatically upon FEC certification that compliant voting systems are available.

**(3) Interim Tabulation Method**

If contingency invoked, states may temporarily use Approval Voting with Sequential Proportional Approval Voting (SPAV) tabulation for multi-member districts:

- Voters approve or disapprove each candidate (binary choice);
- Seats allocated using SPAV to ensure proportional outcomes;
- Same ballot interface consistency principle applies (voters perform same action across all candidates).

**(4) Mandatory Transition Plan**

States invoking contingency must file with FEC:

- Detailed plan for transitioning to compliant STAR-PR system;
- Timeline for compliance (not to exceed 24 months);
- Progress reports every 90 days; and
- Demonstrated vendor engagement and procurement efforts.

**(5) Annual Certification Renewal**

Contingency status must be recertified annually. FEC may revoke contingency status if:

- State fails to demonstrate good-faith compliance efforts;
- Compliant voting systems become commercially available; or
- Technical obstacles are resolved.

**(6) Voter Action Consistency Maintained**

Even under contingency procedures, voter actions remain consistent: scoring or approving all candidates using same interface and action, with only back-end tabulation varying.

### Section 405. Ballot Design Standards

#### (a) Clear Presentation

Ballots shall present candidate information clearly, including:

1. Candidate names in alphabetical order or randomized order;
2. Party endorsements in format specified in Title II;

**END OF TITLE V**

This Title establishes comprehensive compensation and transition mechanisms to align incumbent incentives with democratic reform objectives, addressing the fundamental political economy challenge that electoral reforms require incumbents to vote for changes that may reduce their individual advantages.

Provisions in this Title are divided into:

1. **Immediate Provisions**: Taking effect upon the Immediate Effective Date (Tier 1)
2. **First CMA Election Provisions**: Taking effect at the First CMA Election (Tier 2)

#### (c) Superseding Provision

This section supersedes 2 U.S.C. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ 4501 (congressional pay adjustment) to the extent inconsistent with this section.

#### (d) Effective Date

This section takes effect on the Immediate Effective Date.

### Section 603. Pension Enhancement

#### (a) Accrual Rate Increase

The pension accrual rate for members of Congress shall be 2.5% per year of service, replacing the current 1.7% rate, effective for all service years on or after the Immediate Effective Date.

1. All compensation mechanisms in Title VI that have already taken effect shall remain in force;
2. Other valid reform titles shall continue to operate;
3. Enforcement provisions in Title VII shall continue to apply to all valid provisions.

#### (c) State Authority Preserved

Except where expressly preempted by this Act, states retain authority over election administration, ballot design, and other matters within their traditional purview.

### Section 804. Effective Date and Temporal Definitions

#### (a) Tiered Effective Date Structure

This Act uses a tiered effective date structure to ensure simultaneous integrated launch of electoral reforms while delivering immediate benefits to members:

1. **Tier 1 (Immediate upon Enactment):** Titles VI (Compensation, Transition, and Implementation), VII (Enforcement and Reporting), and VIII (General Provisions) take effect upon the date of enactment.

2. **Tier 2 (First CMA Election):** Titles I (Federal Ballot Access Standards), II (Federal Party Recognition), III (House Membership Expansion), and IV (Multi-Member Districts and STAR Voting) take effect as of the First CMA Election.

3. **Tier 3 (Second CMA Election):** Title V (Non-Qualifying Federal Office Examinations) takes effect as of the Second CMA Election.

#### (b) Temporal Definitions

For purposes of this Act, the following temporal terms are defined:

1. **"Immediate Effective Date"**: The date of enactment, or if enacted after the convening of a Congress, the date of convening of the next Congress, whichever provides incumbent members the benefits of Title VI sooner.

2. **"First CMA Election"**: The first regularly scheduled general election for Congress at which the provisions of Titles I, II, III, and IV of this Act take effect, determined as follows: it shall be the second regularly scheduled general election for Congress occurring after the date of enactment, except that if such second election occurs less than eighteen (18) months after enactment, the First CMA Election shall instead be the third regularly scheduled general election for Congress occurring after the date of enactment.

3. **"Second CMA Election"**: The first regularly scheduled general election for Congress occurring after the First CMA Election.

4. **"Transition Cycle 1"**: The First CMA Election (corresponding to Title IV, Section 402(a)).

5. **"Full Implementation"**: The fifth congressional election following Transition Cycle 1 (corresponding to Title IV, Section 402(a)).

#### (c) Calendar Year References

Where this Act references calendar years (e.g., "January 1 of the election year"), such references shall be construed relative to the applicable election cycle and shall adjust automatically based on when the Act takes effect.

#### (d) Census Data and Apportionment

For purposes of House expansion and reapportionment under this Act:

1. **Census Independence**: House expansion timing under Title III operates on the schedule established in Section 301 (initial expansion at First CMA Election, biennial increases thereafter) and is independent of decennial census timing.

2. **Apportionment Data Source**: When House expansion occurs, apportionment among states shall use population data from the most recently completed decennial census, as provided in Title III, Section 301(e).

3. **Mid-Cycle Adjustments**: For biennial expansions occurring between decennial censuses, states shall redistrict based on available census data, recognizing that population distributions may have shifted since the most recent census.

### Section 805. Short Title Usage

This Act may be cited as the "Congressional Modernization Act," "CMA," or the "Restoring Competition to American Elections Act."

### Section 806. Additional Definitions

For purposes of this Act, in addition to temporal definitions provided in Section 804(b):

#### (a) Electoral Science Office

"Electoral Science Office" or "ESO" means the independent agency established under Section 409(a) responsible for ongoing evaluation of voting method performance, research into technical improvements, and development of proposed modifications to adjustable parameters.

#### (b) Adjustable Parameters

"Adjustable parameters" means the technical elements of STAR and STAR-PR voting methods specified in Section 409(d)(1) that may be modified through the technical review process established in Section 409, including quota calculation formulas, reweighting methodology, seat allocation sequences, tie-breaking procedures, rounding and remainder handling, and audit and verification protocols.

#### (c) Immutable Statutory Elements

"Immutable statutory elements" means the voter-facing guarantees specified in Section 409(c)(1) that may not be modified except by Act of Congress, including the 0-5 star scoring range, ballot interface consistency, universal scoring permission, unscored treatment, single-winner STAR structure, and proportional outcome requirement.

#### (d) Technical Modification

"Technical modification" means any change to adjustable parameters proposed by the Electoral Science Office and approved through the process established in Section 409(g), which takes effect unless disapproved by joint resolution of Congress.

## LEGISLATIVE NOTES (Non-Statutory)

### Summary of Integration

This Act integrates five previously separate electoral reforms:

1. **CASA** (Candidate Access and Standards Act) -> Title I
2. **PREA** (Party Recognition and Endorsement Act) -> Title II
3. **RARA** (Representative Access Restoration Act) -> Title III
4. **ERREA** (Electoral Reform and Representation Enhancement Act) -> Title IV
5. **FCAO** (Federal Candidate Assessment Office) -> Title V

All components work synergistically to restore competitive, representative democracy.

### Key Innovation: Title VI Compensation Mechanisms

The critical innovation in CMA is **Title VI: Transition, Compensation, and Implementation**, which addresses the fundamental political economy problem facing electoral reforms: incumbents must vote away their own advantages.

**Tier 1 -- Immediate Provisions** (take effect upon enactment):

- Phased salary increases ($189,200/$199,200 rising to $250,000/$300,000 over 5 years)
- Enhanced pension formula (2.5% accrual rate vs 1.7%)
- Professional development allowance (5% of salary: $12,500 House / $15,000 Senate)
- Senate appointment authority streamlined
- Election administration funding

**Tier 2 -- First CMA Election Provisions:**

- Enhanced MRA (35% increase, Title III Section 303)
- Multi-member district transition begins (Title IV)
- Public matching funds available (6:1 for donations under $200)

This structure ensures members receive substantial immediate benefits while democratic reforms launch at the First CMA Election as an integrated system, aligning individual incentives with systemic reform objectives.

### FCAO: Independent Agency Model

**Title V establishes FCAO as a permanent independent agency following the Federal Reserve/SEC model:**

**Political Resilience Structure:**
- Multi-branch appointment (President, Chief Justice, House Speaker, Senate Majority Leader)
- Staggered 6-year terms preventing single-faction control
- Supermajority removal protections (6 of 9 votes required)
- Independent funding through examination fees
- Professional expertise requirements and partisan balance

**Institutional Durability:**
- Once established with this structure, FCAO becomes politically entrenched
- Like the Fed, independent agencies with multi-branch appointments are rarely dismantled
- Independent funding insulates from appropriations politics
- Stakeholder ecosystem (testing industry, state officials, civic groups) resists destabilizing changes

**Non-Qualifying Principle Protection:**
- Inviolable transparency mandate: no minimum scores required
- Highest score reporting encourages improvement
- Automatic invalidity of qualification systems
- Mandatory preliminary injunctions for violations
- Congressional enforcement authority with civil and criminal penalties

This permanent structure provides immediate, durable institutional infrastructure comparable to other independent regulatory agencies.

### Cost-Benefit Framework

Title VII, Section 701(d) requires CBO to prepare comprehensive cost estimates including offsetting savings. The findings acknowledge substantial upfront costs while emphasizing long-term savings from:

- Reduced legislative turnover
- Improved policy consistency
- Decreased dysfunction and gridlock
- Diminished revolving-door corruption
- Enhanced economic growth from functional governance

### Political Viability Strategy

CMA's structure addresses the "turkey voting for Thanksgiving" problem through:

1. **Immediate, universal benefits** to all incumbents regardless of party
2. **Gradual implementation** of electoral reforms (phased over multiple election cycles)
3. **Transition protections** allowing incumbents to adjust to new systems
4. **Senate protections and enhancements** to secure bicameral support
5. **Durable provisions** protected by supermajority requirement for repeal

This approach transforms democratic reform from political suicide into rational self-interest, making passage politically feasible while maintaining policy integrity.

### Implementation Timeline Overview

The implementation timeline uses a tiered structure with two key trigger elections:

**Tier 1 -- Immediate upon Enactment:**
- Title VI (Compensation): Phased salary increases begin immediately
- Title VII (Enforcement): FEC and DOJ authority established
- Title VIII (General Provisions): Definitions and administrative framework operative
- Planning and preparation for electoral reforms begin

**Tier 2 -- First CMA Election (second general election after enactment, 18-month minimum):**
- Title I (Ballot Access): Uniform federal standards take effect
- Title II (Party Recognition): Joint Endorsement Lists implemented
- Title III (House Expansion): Initial expansion to 510 seats
- Title IV (Electoral Reform): STAR voting and multi-member district transition begins
- All electoral reforms launch simultaneously as an integrated system

**Tier 3 -- Second CMA Election (first general election after First CMA Election):**
- Title V (FCAO): Examination requirements take effect
- Ballots include FCAO score designations for the first time

**Ongoing -- Biennial Expansion:**
- House increases by 35 seats every two years after First CMA Election
- Cube root compliance (~720 seats) achieved approximately 14 years after enactment

**Example Timeline (assuming early 2026 enactment):**
- 2026: Enactment; Title VI/VII/VIII immediate; preparation begins
- November 2028: First CMA Election; Titles I-IV take effect; House expands to 510
- November 2030: Second CMA Election; Title V (FCAO) takes effect; House at 545
- November 2032: House at 580
- November 2040: Cube root compliance (~720 seats)

This accelerated timeline ensures reform on a human timescale -- members who vote for CMA will see results during their careers, and voters will experience tangible improvements in representation quality within a single political generation.

### Unified General Election Structure

Revision 1.4 introduced differentiated primary structures (nonpartisan primaries for single-member districts, no primaries for multi-member districts). Revision 4.2 unifies all federal elections under a single general election structure:

**All Federal Offices:** Qualified candidates appear directly on the general election ballot without state-administered primaries. STAR voting's scoring mechanism ensures winners have broad support, making the primary's traditional filtering function redundant.

**Party Autonomy Preserved:** Political parties retain full authority to conduct internal nomination processes -- caucuses, conventions, advisory polls -- at their own expense and independent of state election infrastructure. Joint Endorsement Lists provide a streamlined mechanism for parties to signal preferred candidates to voters.

**Core Principles:**
- **Let STAR do the work:** The scoring mechanism identifies broadly supported winners from any reasonable candidate field
- **Consistency of voter experience:** Every federal election works the same way -- show up in November, score candidates, done
- **Administrative efficiency:** One election instead of two reduces costs, shortens campaign cycles, and maximizes voter participation

### Federal Candidate Assessment Office (FCAO)

Revision 1.4 introduced mandatory examination requirement; Revision 1.6 rebranded to FCAO and enhanced framework; Revision 1.7 established FCAO as permanent independent agency; Revision 1.8 reorganizes FCAO as standalone Title V; Revision 4.0 decouples FCAO launch from other electoral reforms:

**Core Principles:**
- **Non-qualifying nature:** No minimum score required; candidates scoring 0% may still serve
- **Office-specific rigor:** Time-based examinations (2/4/8 hours) calibrated to office responsibility
- **Transparency mechanism:** Scores displayed on ballots as "House/Senate/Presidential FCAO Score"
- **Professional standards:** Psychometric rigor, unlimited retakes with highest score reporting, year-round availability

**Implementation Timing (Rev 4.0):**
- **Agency establishment:** Begins immediately upon enactment
- **Exam development:** Completed 18 months before Second CMA Election
- **Administration opens:** 12 months before Second CMA Election
- **First CMA Election:** Candidates exempt; no FCAO scores on ballots
- **Second CMA Election:** Full FCAO requirements take effect

This decoupled timeline ensures adequate runway for exam validation and psychometric certification without delaying core electoral reforms.

**Agency Structure:**
- **9-member Commission** with multi-branch appointments (President, Chief Justice, House Speaker, Senate Majority Leader)
- **Staggered 6-year terms** with supermajority removal protections
- **Independent funding** through examination fees after startup period
- **Professional governance** with psychometric expertise requirements

**Examination Administration:**
- Contracts with professional testing organizations
- Nationwide testing center network plus online proctoring
- Comprehensive accommodations for disabilities
- Rigorous security protocols
- Score turnaround within Commission-established timeframes

**Oversight and Accountability:**
- Annual GAO audits of validity, fairness, and administration
- Quarterly public Commission meetings
- Transparent operations with public practice materials
- Inviolable non-qualifying principle with robust enforcement

**Constitutional Authority:** Elections Clause supports disclosure requirements as part of regulating "manner of holding elections"

FCAO complements ballot access reform by lowering financial barriers while providing voters with objective, professionally-validated competence indicators.

### Relationship to Constitutional Amendment

The constitutional amendment remains a separate, optional enhancement that would:

1. **Modernize qualification requirements** (age/citizenship/residency structure: 5/5, 10/10, 15/15)
2. **Add public service requirements** for Senate (2,000 hours) and President (2,000 hours)
3. **Eliminate natural-born citizen requirement** for President
4. **Optionally constitutionalize examination requirement** with brief language delegating details to Congress

**Current Structure:**

- **FCAO operates via statute** (Title V of CMA)
- **Examinations function under Elections Clause authority** as transparency mechanism
- **Independent agency provides political resilience** without constitutional status
- **Constitutional amendment would provide maximum protection** but is not necessary for FCAO to operate

**Strategic Approach:**

1. Pass CMA with FCAO as statutory independent agency
2. Let examinations prove value over 5-10 years
3. Build stakeholder support and demonstrate effectiveness
4. Consider constitutional enshrinement if desired for maximum permanence

The Fed model demonstrates that statutory independent agencies with proper structure can be more durable than many constitutional provisions.
