## TITLE I: ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE

### Section 101. Short Title

This Act may be cited as the "Office of Congressional Procedure Act" or "OCP Act."

### Section 102. Congressional Findings

Congress finds the following:

(1) Congressional procedure has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of leadership positions, enabling agenda control that functions as an unaccountable veto over legislation with broad support.

(2) The current procedural framework assumes binary conflict between majority and minority factions, creating incentives for domination rather than coalition-building.

(3) Professional, nonpartisan procedural infrastructure exists in virtually every other advanced democratic legislature and contributes to legislative functionality and public confidence.

(4) Proportional allocation of procedural authority -- including floor time, committee leadership, and amendment access -- enables coalition governance and reduces zero-sum legislative dynamics.

(5) Transparency regarding procedural manipulation creates accountability and political cost for abuse of process.

(6) Each House retains ultimate constitutional authority to determine its rules; professional procedural infrastructure enforces rules that Congress itself adopts.

(7) Phased implementation allows institutional adaptation while protecting the reform from premature reversal.

(8) Existing mechanisms for bypassing leadership obstruction, including discharge petitions, are functionally ineffective due to political costs imposed on participants, undermining the democratic principle that legislation with majority support should receive consideration.

### Section 103. Statement of Purpose

The purposes of this Act are to:

(1) Establish a professional, nonpartisan Office of Congressional Procedure to serve as the authoritative source on congressional rules, precedent, and procedure.

(2) Create institutional infrastructure for proportional allocation of procedural authority across party groups.

(3) Prevent procedural manipulation that buries legislation without recorded votes or public accountability.

(4) Reduce crisis governance by enforcing budget process deadlines and preventing procedural hostage-taking.

(5) Enable transition from adversarial to coalitional legislative procedure.

(6) Bring United States congressional procedure in line with international best practices.

(7) Reform discharge petition procedures to create a credible pathway for floor consideration of legislation with demonstrated majority support.

### Section 104. Establishment of the Office of Congressional Procedure

(a) There is established within the legislative branch an office to be known as the Office of Congressional Procedure (hereinafter "the Office" or "OCP").

(b) The Office shall serve both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

(c) The Office shall be independent of the leadership of either chamber and shall not be subject to direction by any member, committee, or leadership office except as expressly provided in this Act.

(d) The Office shall not be placed under the authority of any Executive department or agency.

### Section 105. Mission

The mission of the Office of Congressional Procedure is to ensure that congressional procedure operates fairly, transparently, and proportionally, in accordance with rules adopted by each chamber, regardless of which party holds the most seats or which individuals occupy leadership positions.

(b) The baseline timeline assumes two-party conditions. Acceleration triggers compress the timeline when multi-party conditions emerge.

### Section 502. Phase 0: Consolidation (Years 0-2)

(a) **Effective Date.** Phase 0 begins upon enactment of this Act.

(b) **Duration.** Phase 0 continues for two years unless superseded by acceleration triggers.

(c) **Authority.** During Phase 0, the Office shall:

   (1) Establish the Rules and Precedent Database under Section 401.

   (2) Issue advisory opinions under Section 402.

   (3) Calculate and publish proportional allocation frameworks under Section 403, on an advisory basis.

   (4) Begin publishing Procedural Transparency Reports under Section 407.

   (5) Administer discharge petition procedures under Section 505A, including maintenance of the confidential signature system.

(d) **Limitations.** During Phase 0:

   (1) All Office guidance is advisory only, except as provided in Section 505A regarding discharge petition administration.

   (2) Leadership may depart from Office guidance without procedural consequence.

(b) **Duration.** Phase 1 continues for three years unless superseded by acceleration triggers.

(c) **Authority.** During Phase 1, in addition to Phase 0 authorities:

   (1) **Presumptive Germaneness Rulings.** Office rulings on germaneness carry a presumption of correctness. Overriding a germaneness ruling requires a recorded vote or a formal ruling by the presiding officer explicitly stating departure from Office guidance.

   (2) **Process Certification.** The Office shall certify whether bills have met minimum procedural standards, including adequate time between introduction and floor vote, at least one hearing, and publication of text. Leadership may waive requirements, but waivers shall be publicly flagged in the Procedural Transparency Report.

   (3) **Proportional Allocation Scorecards.** The Office shall publish scorecards grading each chamber's adherence to proportional allocation standards across floor time, committee leadership, and amendment access.

(d) **Limitations.** During Phase 1, proportional allocation remains advisory. Leadership retains discretion to depart from proportional standards, subject to transparency reporting.

   (3) **Amendment Fairness.** For legislation designated as major by the Office, amendment procedures must meet baseline proportionality standards certified by the Office. Failure to meet standards triggers automatic amendment opportunities under neutral procedures established by the Office.

   (4) **Committee Leadership Distribution.** Office certification of proportional committee leadership distribution becomes binding. Departures from proportional standards require a two-thirds vote of the relevant chamber.

### Section 505. Anti-Bottleneck Thresholds

(a) A bill shall be entitled to calendar placement under Section 504(c)(2) if it meets any of the following thresholds:

   (1) **Bipartisan Co-Sponsorship.** The bill has co-sponsors constituting at least 20 percent of members from each of two or more party groups.

   (2) **Committee Passage.** The bill has been reported favorably by a committee of jurisdiction by recorded vote.

   (1) A member may withdraw their signature at any time before the threshold is reached.

   (2) Withdrawals shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed.

   (3) Once the threshold is reached, signatures are locked and may not be withdrawn.

(d) **Progress Disclosure.**

   (1) The Office shall publish the total number of signatures on each active petition, updated daily when the House is in session.

   (2) The Office shall not disclose the identity of signatories or the proximity to threshold beyond the raw count.

      (B) Denial of floor recognition or speaking opportunities.

      (C) Exclusion from party caucus activities or leadership meetings.

      (D) Withdrawal of campaign support, fundraising assistance, or party resources.

      (E) Retaliation against staff of the affected member.

   (5) This subsection does not create a private right of action but establishes a transparency mechanism to impose political cost on retaliatory conduct.

(h) **Security and Integrity.**

   (1) The Office shall implement appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality of signatures during the confidential signature period.

   (2) Any unauthorized disclosure of signatory information prior to threshold completion shall be reported to the Board and may constitute grounds for discipline of responsible staff.
