# Office of Congressional Procedure Act

## Professional, Nonpartisan Infrastructure for Congressional Procedure

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 1.3 of the Office of Congressional Procedure Act

## Overview

Congressional procedure concentrates enormous power in a small number of leadership positions. The Speaker, Majority Leader, and committee chairs control what legislation receives consideration, what amendments are permitted, and what reaches the floor for a vote. This procedural gatekeeping functions as a shadow veto -- killing legislation in the dark before it can succeed or fail on its merits.

The Office of Congressional Procedure (OCP) establishes professional, nonpartisan infrastructure to ensure that congressional procedure operates fairly, transparently, and proportionally -- regardless of which party holds the most seats or which individuals occupy leadership positions.

The OCP does not override congressional authority. Each chamber retains ultimate power to change its rules. The OCP enforces rules that Congress itself adopts, bringing American legislative procedure in line with the professional standards found in virtually every other advanced democratic legislature.

## Key Components

**Professional Procedural Infrastructure** -- An independent office within the legislative branch, governed by an eight-member Board with staggered twelve-year terms and balanced multi-party appointments. Professional staff hired through merit-based processes with tenure protection from political retaliation.

**Proportional Procedural Allocation** -- Floor time, committee leadership positions, and amendment access distributed based on each party group's share of seats rather than winner-take-all control. Every faction receives procedural authority proportional to their representation.

**Transparency Mechanisms** -- Quarterly reports documenting procedural manipulation, proportional allocation shortfalls, buried legislation, and committee bottlenecks. Public database of all chamber rules and precedents.

**Budget Process Enforcement** -- Automatic procedural consequences when budget deadlines are missed, preventing government shutdowns and debt ceiling crises from being used as leverage.

**Discharge Petition Reform** -- Confidential signature period protecting members from retaliation while petitions accumulate support, with simultaneous publication when the threshold is reached. Transforms discharge from a theoretical option into a practical tool.

**Supreme Court Nomination Procedures** -- Establishes deadlines for Senate committee hearings and floor votes on Supreme Court nominations, preventing indefinite obstruction of the constitutional appointment process. Activates with Phase 2 authority and coordinates with the Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act.

**Phased Authority Model** -- Gradual transition from advisory to binding authority over approximately 16 years, with acceleration triggers that compress the timeline when multi-party conditions emerge.

## Implementation Timeline

The OCP acquires authority in phases, allowing institutional adaptation and building credibility before binding powers activate.

- **Phase 0 (Years 0-2)** -- Rules database, advisory opinions, transparency reports, discharge petition reform
- **Phase 1 (Years 2-5)** -- Presumptive rulings, process certification, proportional allocation scorecards
- **Phase 2 (Years 5-10)** -- Budget enforcement, anti-bottleneck provisions, binding committee distribution, Supreme Court nomination consideration deadlines
- **Phase 3 (Years 10-14)** -- Binding proportional floor time, protected agenda space
- **Phase 4 (Year 14+)** -- Full binding authority, neutralized presiding officers

Acceleration triggers compress this timeline when three or more parties hold seats, when no party holds a majority, or when coalition governance emerges.

## Constitutional Authority

The OCP operates under Article I, Section 5, which provides that each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. The Office is an instrument through which Congress exercises its rulemaking authority -- it enforces rules Congress itself adopts. Each chamber retains the power to change its rules, including those governing the OCP, through democratic processes.
