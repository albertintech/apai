# Federal Elections Modernization Act

## Comprehensive Reform of Federal Elections and Congressional Structure

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 5.0 of the Federal Elections Modernization Act

---

The Federal Elections Modernization Act (FEMA) addresses structural dysfunction in Congress through integrated electoral and institutional reforms. All subsequent references to FEMA use "the Act." Rather than treating symptoms individually, the Act combines House expansion, voting method reform, proportional representation, enhanced legislative capacity, and candidate transparency into a unified system that launches together.

The House of Representatives has not grown since 1913, while the U.S. population has tripled. Each representative now serves approximately 760,000 constituents -- six times larger than comparable democracies. Congressional staff drain to better-paying positions in executive agencies and lobbying firms, hollowing out legislative expertise. Winner-take-all elections in single-member districts produce representation that fails to reflect community diversity, while fifty different state ballot access regimes create administrative burden and litigation risk.

The Act treats these as maintenance needs rather than moral failures -- infrastructure problems that have accumulated over a century and now require systematic attention.

## Key Components

- **House Expansion** -- Grows the House from 435 to approximately 720 members over 14 years, reducing average district population from 760,000 to 465,000. Expansion adds seats; no incumbent displacement occurs.

- **STAR Voting** -- Replaces plurality voting with Score Then Automatic Runoff for all federal elections. Voters score candidates 0-5; the two highest-scoring candidates advance to an automatic runoff. Eliminates vote-splitting and spoiler effects.

- **Multi-Member Districts** -- Transitions House elections from single-member to multi-member districts (3-7 seats) using proportional representation. Eliminates gerrymandering's effectiveness regardless of who draws the maps.

- **Unified General Elections** -- Eliminates state-administered primaries for federal offices. All qualified candidates appear directly on the November ballot with party endorsements displayed.

- **Candidate Transparency** -- Establishes the Federal Candidate Assessment Office (FCAO) to administer standardized competency examinations. Scores appear on ballots as voter information. No minimum score required -- voters remain sole gatekeepers.

- **Legislative Capacity** -- Enhances member compensation, staff budgets, and professional development funding to reduce talent drain and strengthen Congress's ability to perform oversight and policy development.

## Implementation Timeline

The Act uses a tiered effective date structure:

- **Upon enactment** -- Compensation and professional development provisions take effect immediately. Members who vote for the Act see benefits during their careers.

- **First FEMA Election** (~2 years after enactment) -- Electoral reforms launch together: STAR voting, multi-member districts, House expansion to 510 seats, and unified general elections debut simultaneously.

- **Second FEMA Election** (~4 years after enactment) -- FCAO examination scores begin appearing on ballots.

- **Full implementation** (~14 years after enactment) -- House reaches cube root compliance at approximately 720 members. Multi-member district coverage reaches 100% for qualifying states (smaller states retain single-member districts).

## Constitutional Authority

The Act operates within established constitutional authority:

- **Elections Clause** (Article I, Section 4) grants Congress power to regulate the "times, places and manner" of federal elections, including voting methods, district structures, and ballot access standards.

- **House sizing** is a statutory matter. Congress adjusted House size thirteen times between 1789 and 1913; the current 435-member cap is a policy choice, not a constitutional requirement.

- **Multi-member districts** have 178 years of American precedent (1789-1967) and explicit Supreme Court validation.

- **FCAO examinations** function as disclosure requirements, not qualifications for office, avoiding constitutional concerns.
