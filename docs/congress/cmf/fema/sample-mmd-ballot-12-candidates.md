### About the FCAO Exam

All candidates for federal office are required to take the **Federal Candidate Assessment Office (FCAO)** examination, which tests knowledge of:

- U.S. Constitutional structure and principles
- Federal government powers and limitations
- Bill of Rights and civil liberties
- Legislative, executive, and judicial branch functions
- Historical context of American governance

The FCAO examination is a **transparency mechanism, not a qualification barrier**. No minimum score is required -- candidates scoring 0% may still run and serve if voters choose them. Scores are displayed on ballots to help voters assess candidates' understanding of constitutional governance and federal office responsibilities.

Candidates may retake the exam unlimited times, with only their highest score reported. This allows candidates to demonstrate improvement and commitment to learning.

**FCAO Exam Range in This Election:**
- **Highest:** Jennifer Kim (Independent) - 95%
- **90%+ (3 candidates):** Kim (95%), Chen (92%), Wilson (91%)
- **80-89% (7 candidates):** Park (89%), Martinez (88%), Patel (87%), Rodriguez (85%), Harris (84%), O'Brien (83%), Mendez (81%)
- **Below 80% (2 candidates):** Anderson (79%), Torres (77%)

## HOW PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WORKS

With **5 seats** to fill and **12 candidates** running, this district uses STAR Proportional Representation to ensure voters across the political spectrum get fair representation:

1. **Your scores matter**: Rate candidates honestly based on your level of support
2. **Proportional allocation**: The system ensures that groups of voters who share preferences get representation roughly proportional to their numbers
3. **No wasted votes**: Unlike single-member districts, your vote counts even if your top choices don't all win
4. **Coalition representation**: The 5 winners will likely represent different viewpoints, reflecting the diversity of the district

**Example Outcome:** If voters in this district are roughly 40% progressive, 35% conservative, and 25% moderate/independent, the 5 elected Representatives might be:
- 2 progressive Democrats (Martinez, Rodriguez, or O'Brien)
- 2 Republicans (Chen, Anderson, or Harris)
- 1 moderate/independent (Kim, Park, Wilson, or Patel)

This ensures everyone gets representation, not just the plurality.

## CANDIDATE SCENARIOS ILLUSTRATED

### Democratic Party Division
The **four Democratic candidates** show party diversity:
- **Sarah Martinez** (Dem, WF) - Moderate, business-focused with labor support
- **Maria Rodriguez** (Dem, Green) - Progressive with environmental focus
- **Patricia O'Brien** (Dem, WF, Green) - Most progressive with maximum coalition support
- **Carlos Mendez** (Dem, none) - No party endorsement despite registration

This demonstrates how proportional representation allows parties to run multiple candidates representing different wings without splitting votes destructively.

### Republican Party Division
The **four Republican candidates** show conservative diversity:
- **James Chen** (Rep) - High Civics score (92%), law-and-order moderate
- **Thomas Anderson** (Rep, Forward) - Reform-minded veteran with cross-party appeal
- **Elizabeth Harris** (Rep) - Business-focused pragmatist
- **Michael Torres** (Rep, none) - Lost party endorsement, running independently

Torres's lack of endorsement signals internal party conflict - voters can see clearly that his own party doesn't support him.

### Independent and Third-Party Options
**Five candidates** outside the Democratic-Republican binary:
- **Jennifer Kim** (none, Ind) - Highest Civics score, true independent
- **Robert Wilson** (Lib) - Academic libertarian, civil liberties focus
- **David Park** (none, Forward) - Tech-focused reformer
- **Sophia Patel** (Green, WF) - Environmental-labor coalition

These candidates provide alternatives to major party options while building coalitions through Joint Endorsement Lists.

### Coalition Building Through Endorsements
Note the coalition patterns:
- **Progressive coalition**: O'Brien (Dem, WF, Green), Patel (Green, WF)
- **Reform coalition**: Anderson (Rep, Forward), Park (Forward)
- **Labor coalition**: Martinez (Dem, WF), O'Brien (Dem, WF, Green), Patel (Green, WF)
- **Single party**: Chen (Rep), Harris (Rep), Wilson (Lib), Rodriguez (Dem, Green)

## WHY RATE ALL CANDIDATES?

Even if you have clear favorites, rating all candidates helps:

1. **Backup preferences**: If your favorites get elected early, your scores for other candidates help determine remaining winners
2. **Coalition building**: Your ratings show which candidates you find acceptable, helping elect representatives who can work together
3. **Prevent worst outcomes**: Rating candidates you dislike as 0 prevents them from being elected with your support
4. **Full participation**: All your scores count throughout the proportional allocation process

**You can't hurt your favorites by rating others!** The proportional system ensures that once your highly-rated candidates are elected, your ballot is reweighted to give other voters fair influence on remaining seats.
