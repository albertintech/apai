## What FCAO Does

The Federal Candidate Assessment Office provides voters with standardized information about candidates' knowledge of government operations. Candidates complete an examination; their scores appear on the ballot.

That's it. FCAO provides information. Voters decide what to do with it.

---

## The Core Principle: Information, Not Gatekeeping

FCAO examinations are explicitly non-qualifying. This means:

- **No minimum score required.** A candidate scoring 0% appears on the ballot.
- **No barrier to serving.** A candidate scoring 0% who wins election serves in office without impediment.
- **No disqualification mechanism.** FCAO cannot remove anyone from the ballot for any reason.

The examination exists solely to give voters one additional data point. Voters already consider party affiliation, endorsements, campaign positions, personal background, and their own impressions. FCAO scores join that mix -- nothing more.

## The Nutritional Label Analogy

FCAO works like nutritional labels on food:

| Nutritional Labels | FCAO Scores |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Provide objective information about product contents | Provide objective information about candidate knowledge |
| Don't prevent anyone from buying products | Don't prevent anyone from running or winning |
| Let consumers decide what matters to them | Let voters decide what matters to them |
| Standardized format enables comparison | Standardized format enables comparison |
| Professional standards ensure accuracy | Professional psychometric standards ensure validity |

You can buy food without reading the label. You can vote for candidates without considering their scores. The information exists for those who want it.

## How It Works

**Examination structure:** Candidates complete office-specific examinations covering constitutional structure, legislative or executive processes, and governmental operations. The House examination takes 2 hours; Senate takes 4 hours; Presidential takes 8 hours (in two 4-hour parts).

**Content standards:** Examinations test factual knowledge -- not policy positions, not ideology, not partisan viewpoints. Questions have objectively correct answers about how government works, not opinions about how it should work.

**Score disclosure:** Scores appear on ballots as percentages: "House FCAO Score: 87%" or similar. Voters see the number alongside party affiliation and endorsements.

**Retakes permitted:** Candidates may retake examinations unlimited times. Only the highest score is reported. This encourages preparation rather than penalizing initial performance.

**Exemptions:** Incumbent officeholders seeking reelection to their current office are exempt. Former federal officeholders seeking any federal office are also exempt, provided they completed the applicable FCAO examination within the past 10 years and the examination structure has not substantially changed. Exempt candidates' ballots display "Exempt (Current Representative)" or equivalent. They've demonstrated competency through service.

## Why This Isn't a Literacy Test

Historical literacy tests were designed to exclude. They featured subjective grading, discriminatory administration, and the explicit goal of preventing certain populations from voting or holding office.

FCAO is designed to include. The structural differences matter:

**Objective scoring:** Multiple-choice and constructed-response questions with clear correct answers. Professional psychometric validation ensures reliability. No subjective judgment by administrators.

**Universal application:** Every candidate for federal office completes the same examination for that office. No discretionary enforcement, no selective application.

**No exclusion mechanism:** The critical difference. Literacy tests existed to keep people off ballots and out of office. FCAO cannot exclude anyone. A candidate scoring 0% has identical ballot access to a candidate scoring 100%.

**Transparency, not barriers:** Literacy test scores were used against candidates. FCAO scores are used by voters -- who remain free to weigh them however they choose, including ignoring them entirely.

---

## Independent Agency Structure

FCAO operates as an independent agency, insulated from political pressure:

**Multi-branch appointments:** Nine commissioners appointed by the President (3), Chief Justice (2), House Speaker (2), and Senate Majority Leader (2). No single branch or party controls the agency.

**Professional qualifications:** At least three commissioners must hold professional credentials or advanced degrees in psychometrics, educational measurement, or closely related fields. All commissioners must demonstrate expertise in relevant domains including assessment design, constitutional law, or public administration.

**Staggered terms:** Six-year terms with three members' terms expiring every two years. Commission composition changes gradually, preventing sudden shifts.

**Political balance requirement:** No more than five commissioners may belong to the same political party.

**Removal protections:** Commissioners can only be removed for cause by supermajority vote (6 of 9). This insulates them from political retaliation.

**Independent funding:** After startup appropriations covering the first 24 months, FCAO transitions to independent funding through examination fees, eliminating Congressional budget leverage as a pressure mechanism. Congress may not reduce or eliminate operational funding after this transition except through legislation specifically amending the Act.

This structure follows the Federal Reserve and SEC model -- agencies designed to make decisions based on professional standards rather than political convenience.

## Implementation Timeline

FCAO examinations take effect at the Second FEMA Election -- not the first. This provides:

- Time for examination development and professional validation
- Opportunity for candidates to prepare with publicly available study materials
- Separation from the initial electoral reforms, allowing voters to experience STAR voting and multi-member districts before adding competency disclosure

The First FEMA Election proceeds without FCAO scores on ballots. Voters encounter the new voting system first; competency disclosure arrives once the core reforms are established.

---

## The Bottom Line

Voters currently lack standardized information about whether candidates understand the institutions they seek to join. Campaign rhetoric and debate performances provide signals, but no objective baseline exists.

FCAO provides that baseline -- nothing more. It cannot block candidates, cannot disqualify winners, cannot create a credentialed political class. It offers information to voters who want it and imposes no burden on voters who don't.

The question FCAO answers is simple: does this candidate understand how the job works? What voters do with that answer remains entirely up to them.
