# 🔍 Candidate Verification and Transparency Act (CVTA)

A federal framework establishing an independent agency to verify and publicly publish factual, documentary records about candidates for federal office -- without regulating speech, imposing ideological tests, or restricting ballot access.

## Overview

The CVTA creates a permanent, independent Federal Candidate Verification Agency responsible for verifying objective facts about federal candidates: identity, citizenship, age, residency, education, employment, military service, court records, and financial disclosure consistency. A separate Federal Candidate Eligibility Panel within the federal judiciary holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional eligibility disputes.

## Key Components

- **🏛️ Federal Candidate Verification Agency** - Permanent independent agency with civil service staffing and strict political neutrality requirements.
- **📋 Standardized Verification Domains** - Eight objective categories with explicit prohibitions on ideological or character evaluation.
- **⚖️ Federal Candidate Eligibility Panel** - Nine-judge panel with exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional eligibility disputes.
- **🔒 Constitutional Safeguards** - Prohibitions on speech regulation, ideological tests, and investigative or enforcement powers.
- **🌐 Public Access Standards** - Free access via web portal, API, and machine-readable datasets with mandatory audit logs.
- **🛡️ Scope Lock Mechanism** - Three-fifths vote required to expand authority; simple majority sufficient to reduce.
- **🤝 Federalism Protections** - Voluntary state cooperation without mandates or preemption of state ballot access authority.
