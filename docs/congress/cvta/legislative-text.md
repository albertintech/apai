# THE CANDIDATE VERIFICATION AND TRANSPARENCY ACT

## A Federal Framework for Verified Candidate Records

### Revision 1.2

---

## INTRODUCTION

The Candidate Verification and Transparency Act establishes a permanent, independent federal agency responsible solely for the verification, compilation, and publication of factual records relevant to individuals seeking federal elective office. The Act is designed to strengthen informational transparency without regulating political speech, limiting ballot access, or imposing ideological or behavioral qualifications inconsistent with constitutional principles.

The structure of this Act emphasizes transparency, uniformity, constitutional restraint, and a hard separation between factual recordkeeping and electoral judgments. Voters remain the ultimate decision-makers. The government's role is confined to verifying basic facts and ensuring that all candidates are subject to the same objective, documentary-based review.

---

## TITLE I: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AGENCY

### Section 101. Short Title
This Act may be cited as the Candidate Verification and Transparency Act.

### Section 102. Purpose
The purpose of this Title is to establish an independent federal agency charged with verifying, compiling, and publicly publishing documentary records related to individuals seeking federal elective office. This Agency operates with limited and explicitly defined authority to provide factual information necessary for the functioning of an informed electorate.

### Section 103. Congressional Findings
Congress finds the following:
1. Public access to accurate documentary information about federal candidates is a foundational component of democratic self-government.
2. Existing electoral systems rely primarily on adversarial discovery by campaigns and media, which leads to inconsistent, fragmented, and unequal access to factual information.
3. A neutral, standardized, and non-discretionary process for verifying factual information strengthens democratic accountability while preserving freedom of political speech.
4. The verification of objective documentary records does not constitute a qualification for office and must not be construed as restricting ballot access or regulating political beliefs or expression.
5. Transparency regarding a candidate's factual background enhances trust, reduces misinformation, and upholds the principle that voters -- not government -- determine who should serve.

### Section 104. Establishment of the Federal Candidate Verification Agency
(a) There is established an independent agency of the United States Government to be known as the Federal Candidate Verification Agency (the Agency).
(b) The Agency shall not be placed under the authority of any Executive department.
(c) The Agency's mission shall be limited to the duties expressly enumerated in this Act.

### Section 105. Status and Independence
(a) The Agency shall operate independently from political influence and partisan control.
(b) No officer or employee of the Executive Branch may direct, supervise, or control the Agency's verification processes.
(c) The Agency shall not exercise investigative, regulatory, enforcement, or eligibility-determination functions beyond those explicitly identified in this Act.

### Section 106. Mission and Core Functions
The Agency shall perform the following functions:
1. Verify factual records relating to identity, age, citizenship, residency, education, employment, military service, criminal or civil court history, and financial disclosure consistency.
2. Compile findings into standardized Verification Reports and Summary Voter Sheets.
3. Publish verified information for public use without commentary or evaluative judgment.
4. Refer potential constitutional eligibility issues to the Federal Candidate Eligibility Panel established under Title III.
5. Maintain secure, transparent, and publicly accessible systems for record publication.

4. The Agency may accept forms returned by electronic mail, postal mail, or secure digital submission through the Agency's public portal.

(f) **Verification Status Notations.**  
The Verification Report and Summary Voter Sheet shall reflect the following standardized status notations:

1. **"Verified"** -- Record confirmed by source institution.
2. **"Authorization form requested; deadline passed without candidate response"** -- Candidate did not return the signed authorization form within the period specified in Subsection (e)(3).
3. **"Authorization provided; subsequently withdrawn by candidate"** -- Candidate initially authorized release but later revoked consent in writing.
4. **"Authorization provided; institution did not respond"** -- Candidate provided authorization but the third-party institution failed to respond to the Agency's request.
5. **"Authorization provided; no matching record found"** -- Candidate provided authorization and the institution responded, but no record matching the candidate's claimed credential exists in the institution's files.
