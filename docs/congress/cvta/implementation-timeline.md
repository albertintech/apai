# Candidate Verification and Transparency Act

## Implementation Timeline

### Published January 2026

Based on Rev 1.2 of the Candidate Verification and Transparency Act

---

## Timeline Overview

The Candidate Verification and Transparency Act (CVTA), hereafter referred to as "the Act," implements through three distinct phases spanning approximately five to six years from enactment to full mandatory operation. This graduated approach allows institutional development, operational refinement, and political adjustment before verification becomes mandatory for all federal candidates.

| Phase | Duration | Primary Activities |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Phase I: Formation** | Year 1 | Agency establishment, leadership appointment, hiring initiation, methodology development |
| **Phase II: Pilot Program** | Years 2-3 | Voluntary verification, preliminary reports, standards refinement, capacity building |
| **Phase III: Mandatory Verification** | Year 4+ | Presidential verification mandatory; congressional verification follows one year later |

The timeline is keyed to electoral cycles rather than calendar years. Mandatory verification for presidential candidates begins with the first presidential election occurring no sooner than four years after enactment. This ensures the Agency has completed formation and pilot operations before handling a presidential cycle.

## Effective Date Architecture

### Immediate Upon Enactment

The following provisions take effect upon enactment without delay:

- **Agency establishment.** The Federal Candidate Verification Agency exists as a legal entity immediately upon enactment (Section 104).
- **Eligibility Panel establishment.** The Federal Candidate Eligibility Panel exists within the federal judiciary immediately upon enactment (Section 301).
- **Interim Director authority.** The President may appoint an interim Director for up to 18 months (Section 1007).
- **Appropriations authorization.** Congress may appropriate funds for agency formation and operations (Section 502).
- **Constitutional safeguards.** All prohibitions on speech regulation, ideological tests, and investigative powers are in force from enactment (Title VI).
- **Scope lock provisions.** The supermajority expansion threshold applies immediately (Section 506).

### Year 1 Milestones

**Months 1-6: Initial Formation**

- Interim Director appointed by President
- Temporary office space secured through GSA
- Initial budget request submitted to Congress
- Core leadership positions posted through competitive civil service
- Interagency coordination initiated with FEC, National Archives, and relevant record repositories

**Months 7-12: Organizational Development**

- Permanent Director nomination submitted to Senate (if interim Director term approaching limit)
- Division heads appointed for five required divisions:
  - Verification Operations Division
  - Data Access and Records Systems Division
  - Public Transparency and Publication Division
  - Office of Legal Counsel and Appeals Coordination
  - Office of Inspector General
- Initial hiring cohort for verification operations
- Verification methodology development begins
- IT infrastructure procurement initiated
- Public portal design and development begins

### Year 2-3 Milestones (Pilot Program)

**Year 2: Pilot Launch**

- Verification methodology finalized and published
- Public portal beta launch
- Pilot verification offered on voluntary basis
- Authorization forms finalized for third-party record requests
- Preliminary reports published for volunteer participants
- Standards refined based on operational experience
- Inspector General oversight protocols established

**Year 3: Pilot Expansion and Refinement**

- Expanded pilot participation
- Full verification report format finalized
- Summary Voter Sheet template standardized
- Machine-readable dataset specifications published
- Public API development completed
- Staff capacity scaled toward mandatory operation levels
- Interagency data-sharing agreements finalized
- State cooperation protocols established with interested states

### Year 4+: Mandatory Verification

**Presidential Cycle Implementation**

Mandatory verification applies to presidential candidates beginning with the first presidential election cycle occurring no sooner than four years after enactment. For legislation enacted in 2026, this means:

- 2028 presidential cycle: Too soon (only 2 years after enactment)
- 2032 presidential cycle: First mandatory presidential verification

Verification must be completed and published no later than 90 days prior to the earliest primary ballot printing. For a typical presidential primary calendar, this means verification reports must be available by late autumn of the year preceding the election.

**Congressional Implementation**

Mandatory verification for Senate and House candidates becomes effective one year after presidential implementation begins (Section 505(d)). This staggered approach:

- Allows the Agency to demonstrate capability on a smaller candidate pool (presidential) before scaling to hundreds of congressional candidates
- Provides Congress an opportunity to observe presidential verification before their own members become subject to mandatory procedures
- Creates operational runway for the larger verification volume congressional cycles require

For legislation enacted in 2026 with 2032 presidential implementation:

- 2032: Presidential candidates subject to mandatory verification
- 2033: First year congressional candidates subject to mandatory verification (off-year elections, special elections)
- 2034: First full congressional cycle with mandatory verification

## Sequencing Requirements

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

The implementation sequence reflects genuine dependencies between activities:

**Formation must precede pilot operations.** The Agency cannot conduct verification -- even voluntary pilot verification -- without staff, systems, and methodology. Year 1 formation activities are prerequisites for Year 2 pilot launch.

**Pilot must precede mandatory operations.** Mandatory verification of presidential candidates without prior operational experience would risk embarrassing failures during the highest-visibility electoral context. The pilot period allows methodology refinement, staff training, and capacity building before mandatory implementation.

**Presidential implementation must precede congressional implementation.** The presidential candidate pool is small (typically under 50 candidates across all parties). The congressional candidate pool is large (thousands of candidates across all districts and states). Scaling from presidential to congressional is operationally prudent.

**Public infrastructure must be operational before mandatory verification.** The public portal, API, and machine-readable dataset systems must be functional before the Agency produces mandatory reports that citizens have a right to access.

### Parallel Activities

Some implementation activities can proceed in parallel without dependency constraints:

- **Eligibility Panel formation** can proceed independently of Agency formation. The Chief Justice can appoint Panel members while the Agency is still establishing verification operations.

- **State cooperation agreements** can be negotiated during the pilot period without waiting for mandatory implementation.

- **Authorization form development** can proceed in parallel with IT infrastructure development.

- **Inspector General oversight** can begin as soon as the IG is appointed, even during formation activities.

## Institutional Requirements

### New Entities Required

**Federal Candidate Verification Agency**

- Independent agency outside executive branch authority
- Civil service staffing for all verification functions
- No more than five percent political appointees
- Five required divisions plus Inspector General
- Permanent appropriation authorization

**Federal Candidate Eligibility Panel**

- Nine judges from sitting Court of Appeals judges
- Appointed by Chief Justice of the United States
- No more than four from same political party
- Non-renewable five-year terms
- Staggered initial appointments to ensure continuity

### Staffing Projections

The Act does not specify staffing levels, leaving this to appropriations and operational judgment. However, the scope of verification suggests approximate requirements:

**Phase I (Formation):** 50-100 FTEs
- Leadership and administrative staff
- Initial verification methodology team
- IT and systems development
- Legal counsel
- Inspector General staff

**Phase II (Pilot):** 150-300 FTEs
- Expanded verification operations staff
- Public transparency and publication staff
- Data systems maintenance
- Increased legal and IG capacity

**Phase III (Mandatory):** 400-800 FTEs
- Full verification capacity for presidential cycle
- Scaled capacity for congressional cycles
- Sustained publication and access operations
- Ongoing methodology refinement

These projections assume efficient processes and modern systems. Actual staffing will depend on verification volume, complexity of third-party record requests, and operational experience during pilot phase.

### Infrastructure Requirements

**Physical Infrastructure**

- Headquarters facility (Washington, D.C. area)
- Secure document handling capabilities
- Records storage meeting federal retention requirements

**Digital Infrastructure**

- Public web portal with search functionality
- Secure internal verification systems
- Document management and workflow systems
- Public API infrastructure
- Machine-readable dataset publication systems
- Cryptographic integrity systems for audit logs
- Redundant hosting with automatic failover

**Interagency Connections**

- FEC candidate filing data access
- National Archives and Records Administration coordination
- State vital records office relationships
- Educational institution verification pathways (FERPA-compliant)
- Department of Defense military records access (with candidate authorization)

## Transition Provisions

### Existing Candidate Information

The Act does not apply retroactively to prior elections or candidates not seeking new office (Section 1006(d)). However, the transition raises practical questions:

**Sitting officeholders seeking reelection.** A sitting Senator seeking reelection in the first mandatory cycle becomes subject to verification like any other candidate. Their prior service does not exempt them from the verification process.

**Candidates in mid-cycle when implementation begins.** If a candidate declares and files with the FEC before mandatory verification takes effect, but the first mandatory election occurs during their campaign, they become subject to verification for that election. The trigger is the election, not the candidacy announcement.

**Information from pilot period.** Candidates who participated voluntarily in pilot verification may have existing reports. These reports should be updated rather than recreated for mandatory verification, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

### Adjustment Mechanisms

The Act builds in mechanisms for adjustment based on implementation experience:

**Rulemaking authority** (Section 1002) permits procedural rules for implementing statutory duties. This allows operational refinement without legislative amendment.

**Five-year rule review** (Section 1002(d)) requires periodic assessment of rules for compliance with statutory limits.

**Simple majority reduction** (Section 506(d)) permits Congress to reduce Agency authority or scope if implementation reveals problems. This asymmetric threshold ensures problems can be corrected without requiring the supermajority needed for expansion.

**Inspector General oversight** provides ongoing assessment of operations and can identify needed adjustments before they become crises.

### Contingency Provisions

**Delayed appropriations.** Section 501(b) specifies that the Agency shall not lapse due to delayed appropriations. However, practical operations obviously require funding. The provision prevents legal dissolution during budget disputes but does not guarantee operational continuity.

**Missed verification deadlines.** Section 810 requires public notice within 10 days if the Agency fails to complete verification for any office or election cycle. The notice must describe the failure, whether systemic or circumstantial, affected offices, and estimated restoration timeline.

**Panel vacancies.** Section 302(e) specifies that Eligibility Panel vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as original appointments. Staggered initial terms should prevent simultaneous vacancies, but the appointment mechanism ensures continuity.

## Implementation Risks and Mitigations

### Identified Risks

**Appropriations uncertainty.** The Agency depends on congressional appropriations. Funding disputes could delay formation or degrade operations.

*Mitigation:* The Act establishes the Agency as permanent with explicit dissolution requirements (Section 501). Budget independence provisions (Section 502) insulate the Agency from executive branch pressure. However, legislative appropriations remain a persistent dependency.

**Third-party cooperation failures.** Verification depends partly on educational institutions, employers, and other record-holders responding to authorization requests.

*Mitigation:* Section 406 establishes transparent status notations for non-response ("Authorization provided; institution did not respond"). The verification process does not fail if institutions fail to cooperate; it produces accurate reports about what could and could not be verified.

**Legal challenges.** The Agency's authority or specific verification procedures may face constitutional or statutory challenges.

*Mitigation:* Title VI establishes robust constitutional safeguards. Section 1003 provides clear judicial review mechanisms. The Act's conservative scope and explicit limitations reduce litigation risk compared to broader regulatory approaches.

**Political interference attempts.** Despite independence provisions, political actors may attempt to influence verification outcomes.

*Mitigation:* Civil service staffing requirements, political activity prohibitions, Inspector General oversight, and felony penalties for manipulation create multiple defensive layers. The separation of verification from eligibility adjudication reduces the stakes of any single verification decision.

### Success Indicators

Implementation should be considered successful if:

- Agency achieves operational capability within Phase I timeline
- Pilot verification produces usable reports without significant errors
- Public portal achieves accessibility and usability standards
- Mandatory presidential verification completes on schedule for first applicable cycle
- Congressional scaling proceeds without operational failures
- No significant legal challenges succeed in restricting core functions
- Public trust metrics (if measured) show confidence in neutrality and accuracy

## Summary Timeline

| Year | Electoral Context | Implementation Milestone |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Year 0 | Enactment | Agency established; interim Director appointed |
| Year 1 | -- | Formation complete; divisions operational |
| Year 2 | Midterm cycle | Pilot program launches; voluntary verification |
| Year 3 | -- | Pilot expansion; systems refinement |
| Year 4 | Presidential cycle | First mandatory presidential verification |
| Year 5 | Off-year | Congressional verification begins |
| Year 6 | Midterm cycle | First full congressional cycle with mandatory verification |

This timeline assumes enactment in a non-presidential election year. Actual implementation dates will depend on enactment timing and the statutory four-year minimum before mandatory presidential verification.
