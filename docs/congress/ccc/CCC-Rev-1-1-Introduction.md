# Congressional Capacity Commission Act

## Restoring Institutional Capacity Through Independent Professional Oversight

### Published January 2025

Based on Rev 1.1 of the Congressional Capacity Commission Act

---

The Congressional Capacity Commission Act establishes an independent nine-member commission to make professional, evidence-based determinations on congressional resources. The Act addresses a structural problem in democratic governance: legislators cannot vote on their own compensation and resources without facing accusations of self-dealing, regardless of substantive merit. This dynamic has produced a 16-year compensation freeze, accelerating staff departures to the private sector, aging technology infrastructure, and inadequate security funding.

The Act's core innovation is its negative consent mechanism. Commission determinations automatically become law after a review period unless Congress actively votes to disapprove them. This preserves congressional authority while removing the political toxicity of affirmative votes on resources. Members can defend their position by noting they did not vote for increases -- they simply declined to override an independent commission's professional judgment.

Implementation proceeds in three phases over 36 months. The first year focuses on commission establishment, methodology development, and baseline studies with no binding authority. The second year introduces limited technical authority over technology and security recommendations, allowing the commission to demonstrate its professionalism and build credibility. Full binding authority over all resource domains begins in the third year.

## Key Components

- **Independent Commission Structure** -- Nine members appointed by multiple branches (President, Chief Justice, House Speaker, Senate Majority Leader) with staggered six-year terms, supermajority removal protection, and professional expertise requirements.

- **Negative Consent Mechanism** -- Determinations become law automatically unless Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval within 60 days (90 days for member compensation), subject to presidential veto.

- **Six Authority Domains** -- Staff compensation and career structures, technology infrastructure, security funding, member support systems (including housing allowance), Member Representational Allowance adequacy, and member compensation packages.

- **Phased Implementation** -- Three-year transition building commission credibility before assuming sensitive authorities like member compensation.

- **Accountability Framework** -- Annual GAO audits, public transparency requirements, limited judicial review, and preserved congressional oversight authority.

The Act follows established precedents including the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC), the Judicial Compensation Commission, and independent financial regulatory agencies. These models demonstrate that professional commissions with multi-branch appointments and insulated funding can make politically sensitive determinations while maintaining democratic accountability.
