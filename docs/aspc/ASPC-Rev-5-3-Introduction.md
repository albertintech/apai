# American Shared Prosperity Compact

## Economic Infrastructure for Stability Across Generations

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 5.3 of the American Shared Prosperity Compact

Economic precarity -- the persistent uncertainty about whether next month's bills can be paid -- affects American households across income levels. Workers face volatile schedules and unpredictable hours. Medical bills arrive without warning. Car repairs drain emergency savings that took years to build. This precarity isn't a personal failing; it's an infrastructure problem. The United States lacks the foundational systems that would give households the stability to plan, invest, and participate fully in economic life.

The American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC) addresses this gap through purpose-built infrastructure rather than patchwork programs. The Compact consists of three separate acts, each designed to function independently while creating powerful synergies when combined. Together, they provide economic security across the entire lifecycle -- from birth through retirement -- through payment systems, adult stability payments, and child investment.

The ASPC is a modular framework, not an omnibus bill. Each act can be introduced, passed, and implemented on its own timeline as political conditions allow. This modularity is deliberate: major reforms rarely pass in single moments of political alignment. The Compact is built for the long game -- architecture that can be assembled over years, across administrations, by different coalitions.

## Components

- **American Payment Network Act (APNA)** -- Creates fee-free digital payment accounts for every American through a nationwide network of banks, credit unions, and post offices. Ends financial exclusion for the millions of households currently unbanked or underbanked, and modernizes federal payment delivery. Establishes *how benefits flow*.

- **American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** -- Establishes income-adjusted monthly stability payments for adults funded by the American Prosperity Contribution, with 20% of revenue shared to state governments on a pure per-capita basis. Includes integrated enrollment infrastructure enabling rapid deployment within months of enactment. Establishes *what adults receive*.

- **Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** -- Provides monthly child stability payments and birth support funded by the Child Security Contribution. Invests in children from birth through age 17, dramatically reducing child poverty while supporting families during critical developmental periods. Establishes *what children receive*.

## How the Components Interact

APNA without APSA or SOCA provides nationwide banking access but no benefits to deliver through it. APSA or SOCA without APNA still delivers benefits, but through existing Treasury systems rather than purpose-built infrastructure. All three together create a unified system where enrollment happens once, payments flow through fee-free accounts, and economic security covers the full lifecycle.

Each act includes conditional language that enables automatic integration when companion acts become available. APSA and SOCA use APNA's Network Accounts when present, but fall back to existing payment infrastructure when not. This creates adaptive legislation that responds to changing infrastructure availability rather than requiring simultaneous passage.

The framework succeeds if all three acts pass together. It also succeeds if they pass separately across multiple sessions. It even succeeds if only one or two pass -- because each act solves real problems and creates constituencies for further reform.
