# American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC)

## One-Page Summary

### Published January 2026

Millions of Americans live one emergency away from financial crisis. Nearly half lack savings to cover three months of expenses. Over 20 million have no bank account at all, paying predatory fees just to access their own wages. American families bear extraordinary costs during the years that matter most for child development -- the United States remains the only developed nation without a meaningful child allowance. When government assistance arrives, the people who need it most wait longest or never receive it because infrastructure designed for a different era cannot reach them.

The **American Shared Prosperity Compact** builds the economic infrastructure America lacks: a modern payment network, monthly stability payments for adults, and investment in every child from birth through age 18. Three integrated acts work together to create lifecycle economic security -- or each can pass independently to deliver immediate value.

**The Three Acts:**

- **American Payment Network Act (APNA)** creates fee-free digital accounts for every American through a nationwide network of banks, credit unions, fintechs, and post offices -- ending financial exclusion and modernizing how government delivers payments

- **American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** provides monthly income-adjusted stability payments funded by the 12% American Prosperity Contribution, with 20% of revenue (~$312 billion annually) shared with states -- creating an economic floor for nine in ten American adults

- **Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** delivers $460/month per child plus a $2,000 Birth Support Payment, funded by the Child Security Contribution -- ensuring every child has a foundation for development regardless of family circumstances

**What Passage Accomplishes:**

- **Lifecycle economic security:** From birth support through childhood investment to adult stability payments, no American falls through the cracks at any stage of life

- **Financial inclusion at scale:** 20+ million unbanked Americans gain free access to the modern financial system; billions saved annually as predatory fees are eliminated

- **Dramatic reduction in child poverty:** Consistent monthly support during critical developmental years, with research showing significant improvements in health, education, and economic outcomes

- **Stable state funding:** States receive predictable revenue through population-based sharing with full autonomy over allocation -- no federal mandates, standardized transparency reporting

The Compact is designed for political durability. Each act has its own dedicated funding stream -- adults and children do not compete for resources. The modular structure allows passage together as an omnibus or separately as conditions permit. Each act creates constituencies that make repeal costly, building the kind of broad-based support that has sustained Social Security for 90 years.
