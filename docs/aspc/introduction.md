# American Shared Prosperity Compact

## Economic Infrastructure for Stability and Shared Prosperity

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 5.4 of the American Shared Prosperity Compact

---

The American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC) is a legislative framework that addresses economic precarity through purpose-built infrastructure rather than patchwork programs. The framework identifies three structural gaps in the American economy -- a payment gap that excludes millions from the financial system, a stability gap that leaves most households vulnerable to disruption, and a child investment gap that transmits poverty across generations -- and addresses each through dedicated legislation.

The Compact consists of three acts, each designed to deliver independent value while creating powerful synergies when combined. This modular architecture allows passage as an omnibus package when political conditions permit or separate passage across multiple legislative sessions when they do not. Each act has its own dedicated funding mechanism, ensuring the programs do not compete for resources. The framework succeeds whether all three acts pass together, any two pass, or each passes individually.

The three acts cover economic security across the full lifecycle: payment infrastructure that reaches every American, monthly stability payments for adults funded by a broad contribution on domestic consumption, and monthly child benefits funded by a dedicated income-based contribution. Together, they establish the kind of economic foundation that peer nations have built over decades -- adapted to American institutional structures and political realities.

## Components

- **American Payment Network Act (APNA)** -- Establishes a nationwide, fee-free digital payment network providing every American access to secure accounts through banks, credit unions, fintechs, and post offices. Self-capitalizing through operational revenues.

- **American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** -- Provides monthly income-adjusted stability payments to approximately nine in ten American adults, funded by the 12% American Prosperity Contribution on domestic goods and services. Includes integrated enrollment infrastructure and 20% revenue sharing to states.

- **Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** -- Delivers monthly child benefits ($300/month for children under 6; $250/month for ages 6-17) plus a $2,000 Birth Support Payment, funded by the Child Security Contribution. Universal benefits with no income-based phase-out.
