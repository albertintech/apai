# American Shared Prosperity Compact

## Three Streams Messaging Framework

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 5.4 of the American Shared Prosperity Compact

---

## The Core Reframe

The American Shared Prosperity Compact delivers value to every American through three distinct streams. This isn't just a payment program -- it's a comprehensive system that invests in you directly, supports you when times are hard, and strengthens the public infrastructure and services in your community.

---

## The Three Streams

### Stream 1: The Baseline Payment

**Amount:** $2,400/year ($200/month)

**What it is:** Your share of America's shared prosperity. Every adult below the clean exit threshold receives this -- not because you're struggling, but because you're a stakeholder in the American economy.

**Key messages:**

- "The baseline covers your contribution" -- For middle-income households, the ~$2,400 baseline approximately equals their APC burden
- "Everyone pays in, everyone benefits" -- This isn't welfare; it's shared participation in shared prosperity
- "Your stake in the system" -- Like Social Security, the baseline creates political durability through broad participation

**Who receives it:** All adults 18+ with income below ~$150,600 (10x FPL)

---

### Stream 2: The Stability Payment

**Amount:** Up to $5,130/year ($428/month), tapering with income

**What it is:** Additional support concentrated on those who need it most. The stability payment recognizes that the same dollar has more impact at lower incomes -- it's economic physics, not charity.

**Key messages:**

- "A floor, not a ceiling" -- The stability payment ensures no one falls into financial free-fall
- "Support when you need it" -- If your income drops, your stability payment rises automatically
- "No cliffs, no traps" -- The gradual taper means you're never punished for earning more

**Who receives it:** Adults with income below ~$105,420 (7x FPL), with higher amounts at lower incomes

**Combined Maximum:** $7,530/year ($628/month) -- deliberately anchored at 50% of the Federal Poverty Level, the deep poverty threshold

---

### Stream 3: The State Investment

**Amount:** ~$931/year per person (at 12% APC)

**What it is:** Your share of APC revenue flowing to your state government. This isn't federal spending -- it's revenue sharing that empowers your state to invest in the infrastructure and services that affect your daily life.

**Key messages:**

- "Not Washington's money -- your state's money" -- Federal collection efficiency, state allocation decisions
- "Roads you drive, schools your kids attend, first responders who answer your call" -- Make it tangible
- "Your state leaders answer to you" -- Democratic accountability at the state level
- "The Campaign Trail Question" -- Every candidate must say what they'll do with your $931

**Total state revenue:** ~$312 billion annually, distributed by population

**State examples:**

| State | Annual Share | Per Household (~2.5 people) |
|-------|--------------|----------------------------|
| California | ~$36.5B | ~$2,330 |
| Texas | ~$28.1B | ~$2,330 |
| Ohio | ~$10.9B | ~$2,330 |
| Wyoming | ~$530M | ~$2,330 |

## Total Value by Income Level

| Income | Baseline | Stability | Direct Total | State Investment | Total Value |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| $0 | $2,400 | $5,130 | $7,530 | $931 | **$8,461** |
| $15,000 | $2,400 | $4,771 | $7,171 | $931 | **$8,102** |
| $30,000 | $2,400 | $4,355 | $6,755 | $931 | **$7,686** |
| $50,000 | $2,400 | $3,688 | $6,088 | $931 | **$7,019** |
| $75,000 | $2,400 | $2,555 | $4,955 | $931 | **$5,886** |
| $100,000 | $2,400 | $657 | $3,057 | $931 | **$3,988** |
| $105,420 | $2,400 | $0 | $2,400 | $931 | **$3,331** |
| $150,600+ | $0 | $0 | $0 | $931 | **$931** |

Even above the clean exit threshold, every American benefits from the state investment stream.

## Audience-Specific Framing

### For Fiscal Conservatives

"The American Prosperity Contribution isn't a tax -- it's a contribution to a system that returns value three ways: cash back to you, support when you need it, and investment in your state. At 12%, it's lower than European VATs and fully funds itself with no deficit spending."

**Emphasis:** Self-funding, no debt, lower than Europe, state control over allocation

### For Progressives

"ASPC ensures that every American -- regardless of age, employment status, or zip code -- receives direct support and stronger public services. The three streams work together: immediate cash relief, automatic stabilizers when times get hard, and sustained investment in the communities that need it most."

**Emphasis:** Universal coverage, automatic stabilizers, community investment, no one left behind

### For State Politicians

"Your state will receive $[X] billion annually -- no federal strings attached. That's [$Y] per resident, every year, to invest in roads, schools, healthcare, public safety -- whatever your constituents need most. The only requirement is transparency: tell your voters how you spent their money."

**Emphasis:** State autonomy, no mandates, democratic accountability, substantial resources

### For Federalism Conservatives / States' Rights Advocates

"Four-fifths of the APC funds direct payments to individuals. One-fifth -- over $300 billion annually -- flows directly to state treasuries. Not to federal agencies. Not with federal mandates. To your state, controlled by your state legislators, accountable to your state's voters. This is federalism that works."

**Emphasis:** State sovereignty, no federal control, subsidiarity principle

### For Working Families

"Three ways ASPC works for your family:

1. **Cash in your pocket** -- Up to $628/month per adult, plus child benefits through SOCA
2. **A safety net that catches you** -- If you lose your job or your hours get cut, your payment automatically increases
3. **Better schools, roads, and services** -- Nearly $1,000 per person flows to your state every year to invest in your community"

**Emphasis:** Concrete benefits, automatic protection, community improvement

## The Campaign Trail Question

A key feature of the state investment stream is democratic accountability. With ~$931 per resident flowing to state governments annually, every candidate for state office must answer:

**"What will YOU do with my $931?"**

This reframes state elections around concrete resource allocation rather than abstract ideology. Voters can evaluate candidates based on their plans for:

- Infrastructure investment
- Education funding
- Healthcare access
- Tax reduction
- Reserve building
- Other priorities

The transparency requirements in APSA ensure voters can verify whether elected officials followed through.

## Comparison to Current Reality

| Stream | Current System | Under ASPC |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Direct Cash | Fragmented (EITC, CTC phase-ins, SNAP, etc.) | Unified, predictable, automatic |
| Stability Support | Cliff-laden programs with work requirements | Smooth taper, no cliffs, no requirements |
| State Investment | Federal grants with strings; state taxes vary widely | Guaranteed revenue, full state discretion |

---

## Soundbites

**The Elevator Pitch:**
"ASPC delivers three streams of value to every American: cash in your pocket, support when times are hard, and investment in your community. It's fully funded, covers everyone, and strengthens both families and states."

**The Bumper Sticker:**
"Three Streams: Your Payment. Your Safety Net. Your Community."

**The Longer Version:**
"The American Shared Prosperity Compact isn't just a check -- it's a complete system. Stream one: a baseline payment that makes you a stakeholder in American prosperity. Stream two: a stability payment that rises when your income falls, so you never hit bottom. Stream three: nearly a thousand dollars per person flowing to your state every year to build roads, fund schools, and strengthen services. All of it funded by a single, simple contribution that's lower than what Europeans pay."

## Integration with SOCA Messaging

For families with children, SOCA adds a fourth stream:

| Stream | Amount | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Adult Baseline | $2,400/year | APSA |
| Adult Stability | Up to $5,130/year | APSA |
| Child Benefits | $3,000-3,600/year per child | SOCA |
| State Investment | ~$931/year per person | APSA (APC) |

**Family Example (2 adults, 2 children ages 6-17, $30k income):**

| Stream | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Adult payments (2x) | $13,510 |
| Child payments (2x) | $6,000 |
| State investment (4 people) | $3,724 |
| **Total family value** | **$23,234** |
