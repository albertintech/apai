# Secure Our Children Act

## One-Page Summary

### Published January 2026

---

The United States has among the highest child poverty rates of any developed nation, with approximately 10 million children living in poverty before the 2021 temporary expansion. That expansion proved dramatic improvement is possible -- child poverty dropped by nearly half -- but when it expired, poverty rates rebounded immediately. American children deserve lasting investment, not temporary measures subject to political winds.

The Secure Our Children Act (SOCA) establishes a permanent, fully refundable child tax credit with monthly payments, a one-time Birth Support Payment for new parents, and dedicated funding through the Child Security Contribution. This architecture provides adequate support for American families while ensuring fiscal sustainability independent of annual appropriations battles.

**Key Provisions:**

- **Enhanced child tax credit:** $3,600 per year ($300/month) for children under 6; $3,000 per year ($250/month) for children ages 6-17. Fully refundable regardless of earned income. Universal benefit for every qualifying child -- no phase-out based on parental income.

- **Monthly advance payments:** Predictable monthly delivery matching family expenses, with opt-out available and safe harbor protection against overpayment liability.

- **Birth Support Payment:** $2,000 one-time payment upon birth or adoption, with advance payment option up to 60 days before due date. Includes compassionate provisions for stillbirth and infant loss.

- **Dedicated funding:** Child Security Contribution of 1.50% of income (plus 3.00% on income above $500,000) creates sustainable revenue without competing in annual budget battles. Progressive design ensures high earners are net contributors even while their children receive full benefits.

- **Automatic stabilization:** Self-adjusting rate mechanism responds to funding fluctuations without requiring Congressional action, with bounds preventing extreme changes.

- **Program coordination:** Credit and Birth Support Payments are excluded from income calculations for APSA Stability Payments and federal means-tested programs, preventing benefit clawbacks.

**Primary Benefits:**

- **For children:** Approximately 70 million children gain access to enhanced support regardless of parental employment status or income, with early childhood receiving higher investment during the developmentally critical years. The credit is for the child, not the parent.

- **For families:** Monthly payments provide predictable income that reduces reliance on high-cost credit. Low-income families without earned income -- currently excluded under existing law -- receive full benefits. Families at all income levels receive support for their children, with progressivity achieved through the contribution side.

- **For fiscal sustainability:** The Child Security Contribution and automatic adjustment mechanism create self-sustaining funding that can weather economic and political cycles without repeated legislative intervention.

Families with children earning below approximately $400,000 receive more in benefits than they contribute. High-income families are net contributors to the program while their children receive the same support as every other child -- because every child deserves no less.
