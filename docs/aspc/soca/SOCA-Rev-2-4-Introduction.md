# Secure Our Children Act

## A Permanent Child Allowance and Birth Support Payment for American Families

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 2.4 of the Secure Our Children Act

---

The Secure Our Children Act (SOCA) establishes a permanent, fully refundable monthly child allowance and one-time birth support payment for American families. The legislation addresses a fundamental gap in American family policy: the United States remains the only developed nation without a meaningful child allowance, leaving families to bear extraordinary costs during the years most critical for child development.

SOCA provides a Child Stability Payment of $600 per month ($7,200 annually) for every child through age 17, regardless of parental income. The credit is for the child, not the parent -- children do not choose their family's economic circumstances, and support for children should not be conditioned on parental income level. Progressivity is handled entirely through the Child Security Contribution's rate structure, making high-income families substantial net contributors regardless of benefits received.

The legislation also provides a Birth Support Payment of $2,400 upon birth or adoption, helping families during the vulnerable transition to parenthood when income typically drops and expenses rise. Research demonstrates that household income declines significantly around childbirth, with single mothers experiencing earnings drops of approximately 31 percent in surrounding months.

## Key Components

- **Child Stability Payment** -- Monthly payment of $600 per child ($7,200 annually) from birth through age 17. Paid as advance monthly payments through IRS infrastructure. Fully refundable regardless of tax liability.

- **Birth Support Payment** -- One-time $2,400 payment upon birth or adoption, available beginning two months before expected due date. Provides flexible assistance during the critical transition to parenthood.

- **Child Security Contribution** -- Funds the system through a 1.50% base rate on adjusted gross income, plus an additional 3.00% on AGI above $500,000 (single) / $1,000,000 (joint). Generates approximately $270 billion annually against ~$257 billion in program costs.

- **Family Security Stabilization Account** -- Surplus contributions (~$13 billion annually) flow to a reserve fund that maintains benefit levels during economic downturns.

- **Safe Harbor Provisions** -- Protects families from overpayment clawbacks. Up to $2,000 per child in overpayments is automatically waived for good-faith recipients whose income exceeded projections.

- **Separate Funding Stream** -- The Child Security Contribution is entirely separate from the American Prosperity Contribution that funds APSA, ensuring the programs do not compete for resources.
