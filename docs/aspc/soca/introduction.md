# Secure Our Children Act

## Permanent Child Benefits Through Shared Investment

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 2.5 of the Secure Our Children Act

---

The Secure Our Children Act (SOCA) establishes a permanent, fully refundable monthly child tax credit and a one-time Birth Support Payment for American families, funded through a dedicated Child Security Contribution. The Act transforms the existing child tax credit from a partial, earnings-dependent benefit into a universal monthly payment available to all families with children under 18, regardless of income or employment status.

The current child tax credit provides up to $2,000 per child but requires earned income before families can claim the full amount. This structure excludes the poorest children -- those in families with little or no wage income, including families with caregiving responsibilities, disabilities, or deep poverty. The 2021 temporary expansion demonstrated that a fully refundable, monthly child benefit dramatically reduces child poverty. When the expansion expired, poverty rates rebounded almost immediately. SOCA makes that approach permanent.

Beyond the ongoing child tax credit, SOCA addresses the acute financial stress surrounding childbirth. Research documents average household income declines exceeding 10 percent during the birth month. The Birth Support Payment provides a $2,000 one-time payment to families welcoming a new child, available within 15 business days of birth or up to 60 days in advance.

SOCA is funded entirely through the Child Security Contribution -- a dedicated, income-based contribution from all earners -- rather than competing for general revenue in annual budget cycles. An automatic rate adjustment mechanism maintains fiscal balance without requiring routine Congressional action. The Act is designed as a component of the American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC), alongside the American Payment Network Act (APNA) and the American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA), though it functions independently.

## Key Components

- **Enhanced Child Tax Credit** -- $3,600 per year ($300/month) for children under 6; $3,000 per year ($250/month) for children ages 6-17. Fully refundable, delivered monthly, with no earned income requirement and no income-based phase-out.

- **Birth Support Payment** -- $2,000 one-time payment upon birth or adoption, with advance payment option and automatic disbursement when systems permit. Includes protections for stillbirth and infant loss.

- **Child Security Contribution** -- 1.50% of adjusted gross income, plus an additional 3.00% on income above $500,000 ($1,000,000 for joint filers). Funds the Family Security Stabilization Account with automatic rate adjustment to maintain solvency.

- **Program Coordination** -- SOCA payments are excluded from income calculations for APSA Stability Payments and disregarded for federal means-tested programs including SNAP, Medicaid, and housing assistance.

- **Non-Filer Access** -- A simplified web portal allows families outside the tax system to claim benefits without filing a full tax return.
