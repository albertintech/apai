# SECURE OUR CHILDREN ACT

## A Bill to Establish a Permanent, Fully Refundable, Monthly Child Tax Credit and Birth Support Payment to Strengthen American Family Economic Security

### Revision 2.5

---

**To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a permanent, fully refundable, monthly Child Tax Credit; to provide a one-time Birth Support Payment to families upon the birth or adoption of a child; to establish the Child Security Contribution to fund these benefits on a sustainable basis; to strengthen economic security for American families with children; to coordinate with the American Prosperity and Stability Act; and for other purposes.**

---

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the "Secure Our Children Act" or "SOCA."

## SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### (a) Findings

Congress finds that:

1. A monthly, fully refundable child allowance reduces child poverty and food insecurity, improves family cash flow, and stabilizes household finances through economic shocks.

2. The tax code should support children regardless of parental earnings in a given month or year.

3. A shared contribution from all Americans -- proportional to income -- provides fair, sustainable, and politically durable funding for child benefits while reinforcing the principle that every citizen has a stake in the well-being of the next generation.

4. Administrative experience from 2021 demonstrated the feasibility of advance monthly payments, while also revealing the need for improved outreach to non-filers and robust safe harbors.

5. Making the credit permanent, inflation-indexed, and simple to claim creates durable anti-poverty effects and reduces bureaucratic friction.

6. Research demonstrates that household income declines significantly around childbirth, with average declines exceeding 10 percent during the birth month and single mothers experiencing earnings drops of approximately 31 percent in the months surrounding birth.

7. The first months of a child's life are critical for development, and economic instability during this period creates lasting harm to child outcomes.

8. A one-time birth support payment provides timely, flexible assistance that allows families to address their unique circumstances during a pivotal period in their child's life.

9. Family economic security is a foundational element of a prosperous democracy and complements the infrastructure established by the American Shared Prosperity Compact.

10. Children do not choose their parents or their family's economic circumstances; support for children should not be conditioned on parental income level.

### (b) Purposes

The purposes of this Act are to:

1. Establish a permanent, fully refundable, monthly child tax credit pegged to child age.

2. Remove earnings phase-ins that exclude the poorest children.

3. Provide a one-time birth support payment to stabilize household finances during the economically vulnerable birth period.

4. Coordinate with APSA so that credit amounts and birth support payments do not reduce American Prosperity Stability Payment benefits.

5. Establish a Child Security Contribution -- a modest, universal income-based contribution from all Americans -- to fund child benefits on a sustainable, fiscally responsible basis.

6. Require transparent reporting, strong error-reduction, and accessible enrollment for non-filers and the un/underbanked.

## SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS

1. **Code** means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

2. **Secretary** means the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate.

3. **Qualifying child** has the meaning given in section 152(c) of the Code, except as modified by this Act.

4. **CPI-U** means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.

5. **Birth Support Payment** means the one-time payment provided under Section 4A upon the birth or legal adoption of a qualifying child.

6. **Gestational parent** means an individual who is or was pregnant with a qualifying child, including an individual acting as a gestational surrogate.

7. **Expected due date** means the date on which a child is expected to be born, as certified by a licensed physician, nurse-midwife, or other qualified healthcare provider.

8. **Child Security Contribution** means the income-based contribution imposed under Section 7(a) to fund the child tax credit and Birth Support Payment.

## SECTION 4. PERMANENT CHILD TAX CREDIT; AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 24

### (a) Amount of Credit

Section 24 of the Code is amended:

1. By striking "$2,000" and inserting "$3,600" for a qualifying child who has not attained age 6 at the close of the calendar year; and

2. By striking "$2,000" and inserting "$3,000" for a qualifying child who has attained age 6 but not age 18 at the close of the calendar year.

### (b) Refundability and No Earnings Phase-In

Section 24 is amended to provide that:

1. The credit is fully refundable without regard to earned income or payroll tax liability; and

2. The present-law earned-income phase-in and additional child tax credit mechanics are repealed.

### (c) Monthly Advance Payments

Subtitle F is amended to add a new subchapter establishing an Advance Child Tax Credit Program under which:

1. Default monthly payments equal to one-twelfth of the annual credit are made for each qualifying child listed on the taxpayer's most recent return or as otherwise verified.

2. Taxpayers may opt out of advance payments.

3. The Secretary shall reconcile advance payments with the allowable credit at filing, subject to the safe harbor in subsection (d).

### (d) Safe Harbor for Overpayments

2. The Secretary shall provide income-based installment agreements for any remaining balance due.

### (e) Age and Eligibility

The credit applies to children under age 18. The Secretary shall prescribe rules for newborns, changes in custody, and mid-year moves to minimize gaps in payment.

   - The intended parent(s) named in a valid surrogacy agreement shall be eligible for the Birth Support Payment; and
   - The gestational surrogate shall not be eligible unless the surrogacy arrangement is terminated and the surrogate retains parental rights.

### (d) Multiple Eligible Parents

1. **Default Rule.** Where multiple individuals qualify as eligible parents for the same child, the Birth Support Payment shall be made to the individual who:
   - Has primary physical custody as evidenced by court order;
   - The child primarily resides with, in the absence of a court order; or
   - First submits a valid application, if neither of the above can be determined.

2. **Joint Custody.** Where parents have a court order establishing shared physical custody, either parent may request that the payment be divided equally between both parents.

3. **Disputes.** The Secretary shall establish procedures for resolving disputes regarding payment eligibility, including documentation requirements and timeline for resolution not to exceed 30 days.

### (e) Application and Verification

1. **Application Process.** The Secretary shall establish a simplified application process for the Birth Support Payment, which may be integrated with:
   - The application for a Social Security number for the child;
   - The non-filer portal established under Section 5(a);

### (f) Effect of Fetal or Infant Loss

1. In the case of stillbirth occurring after 20 weeks gestation, or the death of a qualifying child within 12 months of birth, the Birth Support Payment shall still be allowed to the eligible parent.

2. An advance payment made prior to stillbirth or infant death shall not be subject to recapture.

3. The Secretary shall implement these provisions with appropriate sensitivity and shall not require documentation beyond what is minimally necessary to verify eligibility.

### (g) Inflation Adjustment

1. **Annual Adjustment.** In the case of any calendar year beginning after the first full calendar year following enactment, the $2,000 amount in subsection (a) shall be increased by an amount equal to:
   - Such dollar amount, multiplied by
   - The cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) of the Code for the calendar year, determined by substituting the year of enactment for "2016" in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.

2. **Rounding.** If any increase determined under paragraph (1) is not a multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50.

### (h) Income Disregard

A Birth Support Payment made under this section shall not be taken into account:

1. As income for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;

2. As income for purposes of determining the American Prosperity Stability Payment benefit under the American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA);

3. As income or resources for purposes of determining the eligibility of any individual for benefits or assistance, or the amount or extent of benefits or assistance, under any federal means-tested program (including SNAP, WIC, TANF, Medicaid, subsidized housing, SSI, and any other program defined by the Secretary); or

4. As income or resources under any state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds, for a period of 12 months from receipt.

### (i) Prohibition on Use of Information

Information submitted pursuant to this section may not be used for any purpose other than to determine eligibility for the Birth Support Payment, except as otherwise authorized by law for tax administration purposes.

### (j) Fraud Prevention and Recovery

1. **Penalties.** Section 7206 of the Code (fraud and false statements) shall apply to applications and claims under this section.

2. **Recovery of Improper Payments.** The Secretary may recover Birth Support Payments made to ineligible individuals through:
   - Offset against future tax refunds;
   - Offset against future Birth Support Payments or child tax credits; or
   - Other collection methods available under law.

3. **Safe Harbor.** No recovery shall be made from an individual who received a Birth Support Payment in good faith based on reasonable belief of eligibility, where the overpayment resulted from:
   - Administrative error by a government agency;
   - Change in custody occurring after payment; or
   - Other circumstances beyond the individual's control.

### (k) Funding

Birth Support Payments under this section shall be paid from the Family Security Stabilization Account established under Section 7, subject to the funding provisions and graduated implementation rules of that section.

## SECTION 5. ADMINISTRATION; ACCESS FOR NON-FILERS AND THE UN/UNDERBANKED

### (a) Non-Filer Simplified Portal

The Secretary shall establish and maintain a web-based portal allowing non-filers and those with simple returns to claim the credit and Birth Support Payment by providing:

## SECTION 6. COORDINATION WITH OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS

### (a) American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA) Coordination

The credit amount and Birth Support Payment shall not be treated as income for purposes of determining the American Prosperity Stability Payment benefit under the American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA). The Secretary shall coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (or the agency administering APSA) to ensure credit payments and Birth Support Payments do not reduce Stability Payment amounts.

### (b) Disregard for Means-Tested Programs

For purposes of determining eligibility or benefit amounts under any federal means-tested program (including SNAP, WIC, TANF, Medicaid, subsidized housing, SSI, and any other program defined by the Secretary), the credit payments and Birth Support Payments under this Act shall be disregarded as income and resources for a period of 12 months from receipt.

### (c) State Coordination

States may establish supplementary child benefit programs that coordinate with this Act. The Secretary shall provide technical assistance and data-sharing agreements to facilitate state supplements while maintaining clear separation of federal and state funding streams.

## SECTION 7. CHILD SECURITY CONTRIBUTION; FAMILY SECURITY STABILIZATION ACCOUNT

## OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS & ITEMS FOR CLARIFICATION

**Note to drafters:** Resolve items in this section via committee report language or targeted statutory edits before mark-up to reduce ambiguity and implementation risk.

### A. Fiscal Design & Contribution Mechanics

1. ~~**Rate Calibration:** Are the 0.55% base rate and 1.10% kicker rate appropriately calibrated to generate sufficient revenue with surplus cushion? Request JCT/CBO dynamic scoring.~~ **RESOLVED in Rev 2.3/2.4:** Rates recalibrated to 1.50% base and 3.00% kicker based on cost modeling. Phase-out elimination in Rev 2.4 increased costs from ~$217B to ~$257B. Current rates generate approximately $270B, providing full funding with ~5% surplus for reserves.

2. **Kicker Threshold:** Is $500,000 (single) / $1,000,000 (joint) the appropriate threshold for the higher rate? Consider alignment with other tax provisions.

3. **Solvency Ratio Targets:** Are the 1.10-1.50 healthy range and 0.90-2.00 extraordinary bounds appropriately set? Consider modeling recession scenarios.

4. **Adjustment Increment:** Is 0.05 percentage points the appropriate increment for automatic adjustments? Consider whether larger increments would restore solvency faster during stress.

5. ~~**Adjustment Bounds:** Are the rate floors (0.40%/0.80%) and ceilings (0.70%/1.40%) appropriately set to allow meaningful self-correction while preventing extreme rates?~~ **RESOLVED in Rev 2.3/2.4:** Bounds updated proportionally to 1.10%-1.90% (base) and 2.20%-3.80% (kicker), maintaining approximately 25% adjustment range in either direction.

6. **Two-Year Trigger:** Is requiring two consecutive years outside the solvency range appropriate, or should single-year triggers apply during severe downturns?

7. **Score Sensitivities:** Direction to JCT/CBO on assumed take-up, demographic changes, and behavioral responses; require dynamic scoring appendix.

8. **Sequestration/Paygo:** Exemptions or special treatment to avoid across-the-board cuts during sequestration events.

### B. Eligibility, Identification & Family Status

1. **SSN vs. ITIN Policy:** Restrict to SSN for children (current practice) or allow ITIN to maximize inclusion? Political and administrative trade-offs.

2. **Residency & Abroad:** Clarify eligibility for children who spend part of the year abroad; define U.S. residency tests and documentation.

3. **Mixed-Status Households:** Treatment where parent(s) or child have differing identification status.

4. **Custody & Care Transitions:** Mid-year changes (divorce, foster/kinship care, reunification, adoption); documentation standards and dispute resolution timeline.

5. **Newborns & In-Year Additions:** Automatic enrollment pathways (SSA birth records) vs. portal self-report; retroactivity rules.

6. **Incarceration & Institutionalization:** Eligibility and payee designation.

7. **Child Support Interactions:** Whether CTC is subject to offset/garnishment for child support arrears; policy intent and exceptions (e.g., domestic violence survivors).

### C. Benefit Structure

1. **Safe Harbor Calibration:** $2,000/child sufficient? Consider adjusting based on administrative data from reconciliation.

2. **Age Cutoffs:** Clarify eligibility through the month of the 18th birthday vs. end of tax year.

### D. Administration, Delivery & Integrity

1. **Non-Filer Portal Authority:** Specify data elements, attestation, e-signature, multilingual access, accessibility standards, and audit trail requirements.

2. **Identity Verification:** Balance fraud prevention with access (document lists, remote ID, knowledge-based checks); appeal path for false negatives.

3. **Payment Methods:** Cost ceilings and consumer protections for reloadable cards; ATM network standards; fee prohibitions.

4. **Overpayment Reconciliation:** Define "good-faith" criteria; preparer error safe harbors; installment plan parameters and interest/penalties policy.

5. **Data Sharing & Privacy:** Statutory safeguards for inter-agency data use; retention limits; breach notification; minimization mandates.

6. **Language & Disability Access:** Minimum standards (Section 508, CLAS, plain-language requirements); funded outreach deliverables.

7. **IRS Capacity & Resourcing:** Dedicated appropriations/FTEs; IT modernization timelines; contingency planning for surge volumes.

8. **Territories & Tribal Nations:** Coordinating agreements for Puerto Rico and other territories; Tribal administration options.

### E. Program Interactions

1. **Means-Tested Program Disregards:** Full disregard vs. partial (e.g., first $2,000/child) to balance anti-poverty aims with program integrity and budget coordination.

2. **EITC Interaction:** Modeling of combined cliffs/rates; statutory guardrails to prevent effective marginal tax spikes.

3. **APSA Coordination:** Explicit cross-references to APSA regulations; conflict-of-law rule if agencies diverge.

4. **State "Top-On" Mechanics:** Standardized data-sharing templates; federal admin services menu and cost allocation; reporting cadence.

### F. Legal, Compliance & Appeals

1. **Offsets & Collections:** Limits on Treasury Offset Program for CTC advances; hierarchy of debts; hardship waivers.

2. **Fraud vs. Error Distinctions:** Penalty gradations; de minimis thresholds; voluntary disclosure programs.

3. **Administrative Review:** Timelines for reconsideration/appeals; rights to representation; independent office vs. IRS unit.

4. **Rulemaking Scope:** Clarify delegated authorities and reporting to Congress on major rules.

### G. Monitoring, Evaluation & Transparency

1. **Outcome Metrics:** Statutorily require measures on child poverty, food insufficiency, housing stability, school attendance, and maternal/infant health.

2. **Improper Payment Targets:** Set benchmark and continuous-improvement targets; publish rates by cause category.

3. **Public Dashboards:** Real-time uptake and payment stats by state/county; privacy-preserving.

4. **Independent Research Access:** Anonymized microdata access for qualified researchers with strict privacy controls.

### H. Implementation Timeline & Contingencies

1. **Go-Live Date Feasibility:** Confirm practicality of July 1 start for child tax credit and January 1 start for Birth Support Payment; allow phased rollout by risk tier.

2. **Continuity During Shutdowns/Disasters:** Exemptions to operate during appropriations lapses; disaster-area payment rules.

3. **Sunset Protections:** Anti-sunset clause robustness; treatment under future reconciliation bills.

### I. Birth Support Payment Design

1. **Payment Amount Calibration.** Is $2,000 the appropriate amount? Should it vary by region (cost-of-living adjustment) or household circumstances?

2. **Advance Payment Gestational Threshold.** Is 20 weeks the appropriate threshold for advance payment eligibility? Balance between early access and fraud prevention.

3. **Automatic vs. Application-Based.** Should automatic payment be the default (opt-out) or should application remain required (opt-in)? Trade-offs between take-up rates and fraud risk.

4. **Adoption Age Limit.** Is under-1 appropriate for adoption eligibility, or should older child adoptions (e.g., under 5) also qualify given the household adjustment costs?

5. **Surrogacy Documentation.** What documentation standards are appropriate for surrogacy arrangements? State law varies significantly.

6. **Healthcare Provider Scope.** Is the list of qualified providers for gestational verification appropriate? Should doulas or community health workers be included in underserved areas?

7. **Stillbirth/Loss Provisions.** Is 20 weeks the appropriate gestational threshold for stillbirth eligibility? Should miscarriage at earlier stages qualify for partial payment?

8. **Interaction with State Programs.** Several states have baby bonus programs. Coordination mechanisms and non-duplication rules.

9. **Twins/Multiples.** Confirm that separate payments for each child is the intended policy for multiple births.

10. **Foster Care Placements.** Should foster parents receiving a newborn placement qualify for Birth Support Payment? Policy intent and fraud concerns.

## NOTES TO DRAFTERS

**Universal Child Benefit Philosophy (Rev 2.4):** The elimination of the income phase-out reflects a fundamental design principle: the credit is for the child, not the parent. Children do not choose their parents or their family's economic circumstances. Support for children should not be conditioned on parental income level. This aligns SOCA with the design philosophy of Rep. Tlaib's End Child Poverty Act while maintaining SOCA's superior dedicated funding architecture.

**Progressivity Through Contribution, Not Benefit Restriction:** The Child Security Contribution handles progressivity entirely on the revenue side. A household earning $1,000,000 (joint) contributes $15,000 (1.50% of $1M) while receiving $6,000 for two children -- a net contribution of $9,000. A household earning $2,000,000 (joint) contributes $60,000 ($30,000 base + $30,000 kicker on $1M excess) while receiving $6,000 -- a net contribution of $54,000. There is no need for the benefit side to do double duty through phase-outs that add complexity and create marriage penalty calculations.

**Child Security Contribution Design:** The 1.50% base rate plus 3.00% kicker structure balances universal participation ("everyone pays") with progressivity (higher earners contribute more). The rates are calibrated to generate approximately $270 billion annually against program costs of approximately $257 billion, providing adequate funding plus reserves for the Family Security Stabilization Account. The automatic adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain solvency without routine Congressional intervention, following the Social Security model of shared contribution for shared benefit.

**Rate Calibration (Rev 2.4):** The original rates (0.55% base, 1.10% kicker) were found to generate only approximately 46% of required funding. Rev 2.3 increased rates to 1.25%/2.50%. Rev 2.4's elimination of the phase-out expanded coverage to all children regardless of parental income, adding approximately $40B in costs. The current rates (1.50%/3.00%) generate approximately $270B against $257B in costs, providing full funding with ~5% surplus. Effective rates remain modest: 1.50% for most families, rising to 4.50% for a household earning $1 million.

**Automatic Adjustment Philosophy:** The two-year trigger prevents overreaction to single-year fluctuations while allowing timely response to sustained funding imbalances. The bounds (1.10%-1.90% base; 2.20%-3.80% kicker) allow approximately 25% adjustment in either direction before requiring Congressional action.

**SSN vs ITIN:** The bill allows either for child identification to maximize inclusion; replace with SSN-only if political calculus demands.

**Safe Harbor Dollar Value:** Set at $2,000/child for child tax credit overpayments; can be tuned upward/downward based on JCT scoring.

**Graduated Implementation:** The 50% minimum benefit floor during funding constraints prevents the Act from becoming inoperative while maintaining eligibility. Birth Support Payments receive priority protection given their one-time nature and timing sensitivity.

**Program Disregards:** Full disregards for means-tested programs maximize anti-poverty impact; a partial disregard could be substituted if coordination constraints arise.

**Relationship to ASPC:** SOCA is positioned as a component of the American Shared Prosperity Compact, alongside APSA and APNA. This framing enables integrated implementation while maintaining independent viability of each act.

**Birth Support Payment Naming:** "Birth Support Payment" chosen over "Baby Bonus" to avoid diminutive language, emphasize the support function, and align with SOCA's security/support terminology.

**Fetal Loss Provisions:** Drafted with intentional sensitivity. Families experiencing stillbirth or infant death should not face additional bureaucratic burden. The "minimally necessary documentation" standard prevents intrusive verification requirements during grief.

**Separation from APSA:** The Child Security Contribution and American Prosperity Contribution are maintained as entirely separate funding streams to preserve the fiscal integrity and political durability of both programs.

- Removed "Prepared by" block and "Draft -- Working Document" from header
- Replaced end-of-document marker with standard footer

**Revision 2.4**
- Eliminated income-based phase-out (former Section 4(e))
- Rationale: The credit is for the child, not the parent. Children do not choose their family's income level. Progressivity is handled entirely through the Child Security Contribution's rate structure, making high-income families substantial net contributors regardless of benefits received. This aligns SOCA with the design philosophy of Rep. Tlaib's End Child Poverty Act (truly universal) while maintaining SOCA's superior funding architecture.
- Recalibrated Child Security Contribution rates to fund expanded universal coverage
- Base rate increased from 1.25% to 1.50% of AGI
- Kicker rate increased from 2.50% to 3.00% on AGI above $500k/$1M
- Updated automatic adjustment bounds proportionally (base: 1.10%-1.90%; kicker: 2.20%-3.80%)
- Rationale: Phase-out elimination adds approximately $40B in costs (from ~$217B to ~$257B). Revised rates generate approximately $270B, providing full funding plus ~5% surplus for the Family Security Stabilization Account.
