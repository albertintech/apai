# American Prosperity and Stability Act

## Policy Introduction

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 4.7 of the American Prosperity and Stability Act

---

The American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA) establishes a monthly stability payment for American adults funded by a broad contribution on domestic consumption. The Act addresses a structural problem: the American economy produces extraordinary wealth but fails to provide financial stability for most people. Nearly half of American adults lack savings to cover three months of expenses, and even modest disruptions -- a car failure, a medical bill, a missed shift -- can send working households into crisis.

APSA creates two integrated mechanisms. The American Prosperity Stability Payment (APSP) provides every eligible adult with a stable monthly income foundation, combining a $200 per month baseline with income-adjusted stability payments that provide greater support to those who need it most. The American Prosperity Contribution (APC), a 12% contribution on domestic goods and services, funds the system through a broad, stable revenue base that does not tax income, penalize hiring, or discourage wage growth. At full implementation, approximately nine in ten American adults receive direct payments, while states receive 20% of APC revenue -- roughly $312 billion annually -- distributed by population with full discretion over use.

## Key Components

- **American Prosperity Stability Payment (APSP)** -- Monthly payments up to $628/month for adults with zero income, tapering gradually with rising income. All recipients below the clean exit threshold receive at least $200/month. Eligibility is based on prior-year Adjusted Gross Income and self-attested net worth below $5 million.

- **American Prosperity Contribution (APC)** -- A 12% contribution on domestic consumption, phased in over five years (6% to 9% to 12%). Essential categories including housing, healthcare, education, and financial services are exempt. The APC is border-adjusted to maintain competitive neutrality for American businesses.

- **Bridge Period Funding** -- A hybrid mechanism combining bounded deficit financing, temporary progressive bridge taxes, and early APC collection to deliver benefits within months of enactment rather than waiting for full APC implementation.

- **Federal-State Revenue Sharing** -- 20% of APC revenue flows to state governments on a pure population-share basis with full allocation discretion and transparency reporting requirements.

- **Stability Buffer and Automatic Adjustment** -- A reserve fund ensuring uninterrupted payments during economic downturns, with automatic rate adjustment mechanisms that eliminate dependence on annual Congressional action.

- **Rapid Deployment Framework** -- Staggered enrollment using existing IRS, SSA, and Treasury infrastructure to reach tax filers within 90 days and all eligible adults within 12 months. Benefits accrue from day one and are held in trust until delivered.
