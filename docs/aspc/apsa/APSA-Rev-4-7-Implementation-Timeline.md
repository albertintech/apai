# American Prosperity and Stability Act

## Implementation Timeline

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 4.7 of the American Prosperity and Stability Act

---

## Timeline Overview

APSA implementation spans approximately five years from enactment to full steady-state operation, organized into four phases: Bridge Period (months 0-24), Launch (years 1-2), Expansion (years 3-4), and Full Implementation (year 5 forward). Benefits begin accruing on the day of enactment and reach eligible recipients as rapidly as administrative infrastructure permits. The full APC rate and APSP benefit structure are operational by month 49.

| Phase | Timeline | APC Rate | APSP Scale | Max Monthly Benefit |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| Bridge Period | Months 0-24 | 3-4% pre-collection + bridge taxes | 40% | ~$371 |
| Launch | Years 1-2 | 6% | 40% | ~$371 |
| Expansion | Years 3-4 | 9% | 69% | ~$495 |
| Full Implementation | Year 5+ | 12% | 100% | ~$628 |

The baseline payment ($200/month) is paid in full from the Launch Phase onward. Only the income-adjusted stability payment scales with the APC rate during phase-in.

## Effective Date Architecture

### Immediate (Upon Enactment)

The following provisions take effect upon enactment and require no additional Congressional action:

- APSP benefit accrual begins for all eligible individuals
- American Prosperity Oversight Council authorized
- Stability Buffer established within Treasury
- Treasury rulemaking authority for APC collection procedures activated
- SSA data-sharing mandate for non-filer identification
- Simple Form establishment authority granted
- Bridge taxes take effect the following calendar quarter

### Short-Term (Months 1-12)

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| 1-3 | Bridge taxes operational; deficit borrowing authorized |
| 1-90 days | Tax filers with direct deposit enrolled via IRS systems |
| 1-90 days | SSA beneficiaries enrolled via SSA payment systems |
| 1-120 days | Tax filers without direct deposit enrolled via Treasury outreach |
| 1-180 days | Non-filers with earnings history enrolled via SSA employer records |
| 6-12 | Rapid deployment reaches 80%+ of eligible population |
| 12 | Community outreach and APN Agent enrollment for hardest-to-reach populations underway |

### Medium-Term (Months 12-48)

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| 12-18 | APC pre-collection begins at 3-4% rate |
| 18-24 | APC reaches Launch rate (6%); pre-collection phase ends |
| 24 | Bridge Period end certified (two quarters self-funding + Buffer minimum) |
| 24-30 | Bridge taxes sunset automatically; statutory payback begins |
| 25 | APC rate increases to 9%; APSP benefits scale to 69% |
| 36 | State revenue sharing fully operational; Stability Buffer target increases |
| 36 | First annual State APC Revenue Reports due (~15 months post-enactment) |

### Long-Term (Year 5+)

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| 49 | APC rate reaches 12%; APSP benefits at 100% ($628/month maximum) |
| 60 | Stability Buffer at 12-month target reserve |
| 60-96 | Bridge Period Borrowing fully retired (estimated 6-8 years post-Bridge) |
| 60+ | Program consolidation evaluation may begin where consolidation improves household outcomes |

## Sequencing Requirements

### Hard Dependencies

Each action in the left column must be completed before the action it precedes:

| Must Complete | Before | Rationale |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| Enactment | Benefit accrual | Legal authority required |
| IRS data access | Tax filer enrollment | Eligibility verification requires filing records |
| SSA coordination MOU (60 days) | SSA beneficiary enrollment | Identity and payment data sharing |
| Treasury rulemaking | APC collection | Businesses need compliance rules before collection begins |
| APC operational for 2 quarters + Buffer minimum | Bridge Period end certification | Self-funding requirement is statutory |

### Parallel Workstreams

Several implementation tracks proceed simultaneously without dependency on each other:

- IRS enrollment of tax filers and SSA enrollment of beneficiaries operate independently
- APC rulemaking and enrollment infrastructure development proceed in parallel
- State revenue sharing template development occurs during the Bridge Period
- Stability Buffer accumulation begins as soon as revenue exceeds immediate obligations
- Treasury dashboard and public reporting infrastructure can be built during Bridge Period

### Soft Dependencies

| Action | Optimally Precedes | Fallback If Unavailable |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| APNA operational | APSP payment delivery | Use existing Treasury systems (Direct Express, direct deposit, checks) |
| Stability Buffer at target | APC rate increases | Proceed with increases; buffer builds during operation |
| State reporting template finalized | First state reporting deadline | Treasury provides interim guidance |

## Institutional Requirements

### New Entities

**American Prosperity Oversight Council** -- Monitors APC revenue, APSP distribution, state revenue sharing, and system performance. Comprises Treasury Secretary (chair), IRS Commissioner, SSA Commissioner, three presidential appointees with Senate confirmation (6-year staggered terms), two House Speaker appointees, and two Senate Majority Leader appointees. Authorized upon enactment; nominations should be prepared pre-enactment.

**Stability Buffer** -- Reserve fund within Treasury maintaining 6-12 months of projected APSP outlays. Established upon enactment; funded from APC surplus after benefit obligations are met.

### Existing Agency Responsibilities

| Agency | Function |
|--------|----------|
| IRS | Eligibility determination, APC collection, asset attestation verification |
| Bureau of the Fiscal Service | Payment distribution, state revenue sharing, Stability Buffer management |
| SSA | Data sharing for non-filer identification, outreach to non-filers via earnings records |
| Treasury IG for Tax Administration | Program oversight and reporting |
| Treasury (general) | APC rulemaking, state reporting template, public dashboard, Bridge Period Borrowing management |

### Workforce Requirements

The Secretary must complete a workforce capacity assessment within 180 days of enactment, covering IRS and Treasury capacity for enrollment and payment distribution. GAO reviews the assessment within 90 days. Biennial reassessments continue through the phase-in period and sunset upon Full Implementation certification.

## Transition Provisions

### Bridge Period Funding Transition

The transition from hybrid funding to self-sustaining APC revenue is designed to be invisible to recipients:

- Benefits accrue and are paid continuously regardless of funding source
- Bridge taxes phase out automatically upon Bridge Period end certification
- APC rate escalation from pre-collection (3-4%) through Launch (6%) through Expansion (9%) to Full (12%) follows a statutory schedule
- Statutory payback of Bridge Period Borrowing begins from APC surplus and does not affect benefit levels

### Program Interaction Transition

- All existing federal benefit programs continue during phase-in with no reductions
- SSI and TANF permanent disregards take effect immediately upon first APSP payment delivery
- Gradual-adjustment programs (SNAP, Medicaid, Section 8) treat APSP as income through their existing mechanisms
- Program consolidation is deferred until APSP reaches operational maturity and is considered only where consolidation demonstrably improves household outcomes

### Payment Infrastructure Transition

If APNA is enacted concurrently or subsequently, APSP payments transition from existing Treasury systems (direct deposit, Direct Express, paper checks) to Network Accounts as APNA infrastructure becomes operational. If APNA is not enacted, APSA operates indefinitely through standalone Treasury payment infrastructure.

---

## Fiscal Contingencies

### Recession During Implementation

APSP payments are never reduced due to revenue shortfalls. The Stability Buffer absorbs gaps between APC revenue and benefit obligations. If the buffer falls below its 6-month minimum for two consecutive quarters, the APC rate automatically increases by 0.25 percentage points (cumulative cap of 2 points). The APSP also functions as an automatic stabilizer: as incomes fall during recession, more individuals become eligible and existing recipients receive higher stability payments, injecting demand when it is most needed.

### Implementation Interruption

If political circumstances prevent scheduled APC rate increases, the system continues operating at whatever phase it has reached. The existing APC rate continues, APSP benefits continue at the current scale, and the Stability Buffer provides continuity. No automatic escalation occurs without the scheduled rate increase.
