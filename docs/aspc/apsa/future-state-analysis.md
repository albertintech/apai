# American Prosperity and Stability Act

## Future State Analysis

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 4.8 of the American Prosperity and Stability Act

---

This document maps the causal chain from identified dysfunction in America's economic stability infrastructure to the specific legislative mechanisms in the American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA), hereafter referred to as "the Act," and the expected outcomes those mechanisms produce. Data and claims are drawn from the Act's legislative text, Policy Rationale, Overview, Implementation Timeline, and Constituency Impact Analysis. The analysis is organized by problem set rather than legislative structure.

## Part I: Structural Overview

### The Status Quo

The American economy generates unprecedented aggregate wealth while failing to deliver financial stability to most of its participants. Nearly half of American adults lack savings to cover three months of expenses. Housing, healthcare, childcare, and education costs have outpaced wage growth for decades, compressing the financial runway that families need to plan, invest, and build. When disruptions arrive -- a car breakdown, a medical bill, a seasonal layoff -- households without buffers enter crisis.

This instability is not simply an economic problem. It shapes family formation decisions, geographic mobility, educational attainment, labor market dynamics, and political behavior. When financial survival dominates daily life, democratic participation becomes a luxury. Fear converts to resentment, resentment to division, and division to institutional fracture.

The federal government's existing tools for addressing economic precarity are fragmented, means-tested, stigmatizing, and politically fragile. Programs like SNAP, TANF, and Medicaid reach some populations but impose administrative burden, create benefit cliffs that punish work and marriage, and divide the electorate into "taxpayers" and "beneficiaries" -- a division that invites backlash and retrenchment. When crises demand rapid intervention, as during COVID-19, the government must improvise payment systems from scratch, delaying relief by weeks or months. No permanent infrastructure exists for delivering economic stability at scale.

### The Future State

The Act establishes the American Prosperity Stability Payment (APSP) -- a monthly income floor for every eligible adult -- funded by the American Prosperity Contribution (APC), a 12% broad-based contribution on goods and services sold for domestic use. Together they create a stability feedback loop: the APC generates predictable revenue; the APSP translates that revenue into household financial security; stable households generate stable consumer demand; stable demand sustains APC revenue.

Approximately 90% of American adults (241 million) receive monthly payments. The combined maximum benefit of $628 per month ($7,530 per year) is anchored at 50% of the Federal Poverty Level -- the deep poverty threshold. A $200/month baseline goes to all recipients below the clean exit threshold (10x FPL, approximately $150,600). Twenty percent of APC revenue (approximately $312 billion annually) flows to state governments by pure population share. A Bridge Period funding mechanism delivers benefits within months of enactment. Automatic adjustment mechanisms maintain solvency without annual Congressional action.

## Part II: Problem Set, Mechanism, and Outcome Analysis

### 1. Economic Precarity Among Working-Age Adults

**Status Quo Problem.** Despite extraordinary national productivity, most American households operate without meaningful financial buffers. Nearly half of adults lack savings to cover three months of expenses. Even dual-earner households often cannot absorb modest disruptions without crisis. The federal government provides no general economic stability mechanism for working-age adults comparable to Social Security's function for retirees. Existing safety net programs -- SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, Section 8 -- are means-tested, administratively burdensome, stigmatized, and reach only a fraction of those in precarity. They divide the electorate into perceived "makers" and "takers," creating political conditions for their own retrenchment. The result is that tens of millions of Americans live in survival mode -- unable to plan, invest in education, relocate for opportunity, or participate fully in civic life.

**Act Mechanism.** Title II establishes the APSP, providing monthly stability payments to all eligible adults. The benefit uses a two-component structure: a flat baseline payment of $200/month available to all recipients below the clean exit threshold (10x FPL), plus an income-adjusted stability payment of up to $428/month that tapers gradually using a logarithmic formula. The combined maximum benefit of $628/month ($7,530/year) at zero income is anchored at 50% of the Federal Poverty Level. Eligibility requires no application beyond standard tax filing or a one-page Simple Form for non-filers. Title III establishes the APC at 12% on goods and services sold for domestic use -- with exemptions for housing, healthcare, education, and financial services -- generating approximately $1.56 trillion annually at full implementation.

**Outcome: Household Economic Stability Infrastructure.** The APSP creates a permanent income floor that absorbs economic shocks without requiring crisis-driven legislative action. At zero income, the benefit alone meets the deep poverty threshold. At median individual income (~$40,000), the net benefit after APC contributions remains substantially positive (~$2,000+ annually). The "everyone pays, everyone benefits" structure covering 90% of adults eliminates the maker/taker division that undermines means-tested programs. Households gain the financial runway to plan beyond immediate survival -- enabling education, career transitions, geographic mobility, and family formation decisions that precarity currently forecloses.

### 2. Slow Federal Crisis Response

**Status Quo Problem.** When economic crises demand rapid cash delivery to households, the federal government has no standing infrastructure for the task. During COVID-19, Congress authorized stimulus payments totaling approximately $931 billion across three rounds, but delivery was delayed by weeks or months for millions of Americans -- particularly those without direct deposit on file, those who had changed banks, non-filers outside the IRS system, and those in institutional settings. Each round required improvised delivery mechanisms. The IRS had to build "Get My Payment" portals from scratch. Paper checks took months to reach recipients. Prepaid cards caused confusion. The government spent hundreds of millions on administrative workarounds for infrastructure that should have existed before the crisis. Every future crisis will face the same problem unless permanent delivery infrastructure is built during non-crisis conditions.

**Act Mechanism.** Section 10 establishes a Rapid Deployment framework. Benefits accrue for all eligible adults from the date of enactment, regardless of when enrollment is completed, with accrued amounts held in trust by Treasury. Staggered administrative targets prioritize populations with existing infrastructure connections: tax filers with direct deposit within 90 days, SSA beneficiaries within 120 days, non-filers with earnings history within 180 days, and all remaining eligible adults within 12 months. The Simple Form for non-filers is available at SSA field offices, public libraries, post offices, and online. SSA coordinates with Treasury to identify and reach adults not in the tax filing system. When the American Payment Network Act (APNA) is operational, Network Accounts provide an additional universal delivery channel.

**Outcome: Permanent Rapid Payment Infrastructure.** Once the APSP is operational, the enrollment database and payment delivery systems exist permanently. Future crises requiring cash delivery to households do not require building new infrastructure -- the system is already running. The 90-day/120-day/180-day/12-month staggered targets demonstrate feasibility at scale. The Day 1 accrual principle ensures that administrative delays do not deprive anyone of benefits they have earned. The system reaches populations that current crisis mechanisms miss -- non-filers, the unbanked, adults without stable addresses -- through the Simple Form and SSA coordination infrastructure that becomes permanent federal capacity.

### 3. State Fiscal Instability

**Status Quo Problem.** State governments face chronic revenue instability. Sales taxes -- the primary revenue source for most states -- collapse during recessions precisely when demand for public services rises. Income taxes are similarly volatile. This forces states into procyclical budget cuts: laying off teachers, delaying infrastructure maintenance, cutting Medicaid provider rates, and reducing social services when they are most needed. The resulting austerity deepens recessions at the state level and imposes long-term costs -- deferred maintenance, educational disruption, delayed infrastructure -- that compound over decades. Federal revenue sharing mechanisms that once partially addressed this problem have been eliminated or reduced. States have no access to stable, predictable, formula-driven federal revenue sharing comparable to what the Act provides.

**Act Mechanism.** Title IV directs 20% of APC revenue to state governments through a pure population share formula. At full implementation with a 12% APC rate, this provides approximately $312 billion annually -- roughly $931 per resident. Distribution uses a completely transparent formula: each state's share equals its percentage of the national population. States retain full autonomy over allocation with no federal mandates, earmarks, or program requirements. Accountability is maintained through standardized annual reporting using Treasury format and a public comparison dashboard. An enforcement ladder for non-reporting escalates from technical assistance through escrowed funds to penalties redistributed to compliant states.

**Outcome: Stabilized State Budgets With Democratic Accountability.** States gain access to stable, countercyclical revenue that does not collapse during recessions (the APC is consumption-based, providing more stability than income taxes though less than property taxes). The pure population formula eliminates formula gaming, lobbying over allocation weights, and perceived unfairness. Complete state autonomy over spending allows every state to address its own priorities -- education, infrastructure, tax reduction, reserves -- while standardized reporting creates voter accountability. Every citizen can see how their state's allocation decisions compare to peer states. The framework appeals across partisan lines: state's rights conservatives value federal resources without federal control; progressive federalists value transparent democratic deliberation; fiscal conservatives value the absence of new federal bureaucracy evaluating state choices.

### 4. Working-Years Coverage Gap in the Social Safety Net

**Status Quo Problem.** Social Security provides economic stability infrastructure for retirees. The APSP equivalent for working-age adults does not exist. Americans between ages 18 and retirement face decades of economic exposure with no comparable income floor. Existing programs (SNAP, TANF, UI) are temporary, means-tested, and fragmentary -- they provide emergency relief for specific categories of need rather than general economic stability. A 35-year-old facing a job loss, a health crisis, or a family disruption has no permanent income floor to prevent freefall. The working years are precisely when families are formed, careers are built, children are raised, and futures are determined -- yet these are the years with the least structural economic protection. This gap is not an oversight; it reflects a policy architecture designed before the modern labor market's instability, before the erosion of employer-provided benefits, and before the cost escalation in housing, healthcare, and education that has compressed household financial margins.

**Act Mechanism.** Title II provides monthly APSP payments to all eligible adults age 18 and older with no upper age limit. The benefit operates alongside Social Security: working-age adults receive APSP during the years Social Security does not cover; retirees receive both Social Security and APSP based on their AGI. The system is permanent -- not a temporary program subject to reauthorization -- with automatic indexing to Federal Poverty Level multiples that adjust without Congressional action. The APC funds APSP through dedicated revenue rather than competing for annual appropriations.

**Outcome: Lifecycle Economic Security.** The APSP extends the Social Security principle -- shared contribution funding shared stability -- to the full adult lifecycle. Working-age adults gain the same structural income floor that retirees have relied on since 1935. Combined with Social Security, the result is economic stability infrastructure from age 18 through death. For retirees, the APSP supplements Social Security: a senior receiving $18,000 in Social Security benefits receives an additional ~$3,400 in APSP annually, for total support of ~$21,400. The complementary relationship strengthens both programs' political constituencies rather than creating competition between age groups.

### 5. Appropriations Vulnerability of Stability Programs

**Status Quo Problem.** Federal programs dependent on annual appropriations are vulnerable to government shutdowns, continuing resolution gaps, debt ceiling crises, and political hostage-taking. Means-tested programs are especially vulnerable because their constituencies -- by definition, lower-income populations -- have less political power to defend against cuts. TANF has been frozen at its 1996 funding level for nearly three decades, losing approximately 40% of its real value to inflation. SNAP faces recurring reauthorization battles. Even Social Security, with its dedicated funding stream, faces periodic solvency concerns that generate uncertainty. Programs without dedicated revenue and broad constituencies are structurally exposed to erosion.

**Act Mechanism.** The APC creates a dedicated, self-sustaining revenue stream that funds the APSP without annual appropriation. The Stability Buffer (Title V) maintains reserves of 6-12 months of projected outlays. If the buffer falls below the 6-month minimum for two consecutive quarters, the APC rate automatically increases by 0.25 percentage points, up to a 2-point cumulative cap. Automatic increases reverse when reserves recover. A solvency trigger requires Congressional notification and action if reserves are projected to exhaust within 18 months. These mechanisms operate automatically, requiring no legislative action to maintain program solvency during normal economic variation.

**Outcome: Politically Durable, Self-Correcting Fiscal Architecture.** The APSP does not compete for annual appropriations. It cannot be defunded through a continuing resolution or government shutdown. Automatic adjustment mechanisms respond to economic fluctuations without requiring Congressional action -- eliminating the legislative inertia that allows programs to erode. The 90% coverage rate creates a massive political constituency: 241 million adults receiving direct monthly payments, plus 50 state governments receiving population-proportional revenue sharing. Attacking the program means attacking benefits received by nine in ten voters. This is the same structural logic that has protected Social Security for nine decades -- replicated with modern fiscal mechanisms that address Social Security's known solvency vulnerabilities.

### 6. Marriage and Filing Penalties in Benefit Programs

**Status Quo Problem.** Many federal benefit programs create marriage penalties -- couples who marry lose benefits they would retain if they remained unmarried. The Earned Income Tax Credit, for example, can produce effective marginal tax rates above 50% when a second earner's income pushes a married couple above phase-out thresholds. Housing assistance, Medicaid eligibility, and SNAP benefits all incorporate household income calculations that penalize marriage or cohabitation. These penalties are not incidental design flaws; they are structural consequences of means-testing against household income. They distort family formation decisions, create perverse incentives for couples to remain legally unmarried, and generate resentment among populations who perceive the government as punishing their choices.

**Act Mechanism.** Title II calculates all APSP benefits on an individual basis using individual AGI. A person's benefit depends solely on their own income, not their spouse's income, household composition, or filing status. Two individuals earning $30,000 each receive the same combined APSP regardless of whether they are married, cohabiting, or living separately. The clean exit threshold, stability payment taper, and baseline payment all apply to individuals. No provision references household size, marital status, or combined income.

**Outcome: Marriage Neutrality by Design.** The APSP creates zero marriage penalty and zero marriage bonus. Two people considering marriage face no change in their combined APSP benefits regardless of their decision. This eliminates a persistent source of distortion in family formation decisions and removes a politically potent attack vector -- no critic can claim the program punishes marriage or rewards single parenthood. Individual-basis calculation also simplifies administration: no household composition verification, no cohabitation investigations, no complex filing status rules. The design choice reflects the principle that economic stability policy should support family decisions, not distort them.

### 7. Benefit Cliffs and Work Disincentives in Existing Programs

**Status Quo Problem.** Traditional means-tested programs phase out benefits sharply as income rises, creating effective marginal tax rates that can exceed 50% -- sometimes exceeding 70% when multiple program phase-outs overlap. A household receiving SNAP, Medicaid, housing assistance, and the Earned Income Tax Credit can face a situation where earning an additional $5,000 in wages results in a net loss after benefit reductions. These cliff effects trap households in poverty by making work economically irrational at critical income thresholds. They also generate political opposition: critics point to work disincentives as evidence that the safety net creates dependency. The disincentives are real -- but they are artifacts of program design, not inherent features of income support.

**Act Mechanism.** Title II uses a logarithmic (concave) taper formula for the income-adjusted stability payment. The formula concentrates phase-out at lower effective marginal rates -- the taper is steepest at the lowest incomes (where total benefit is highest and the phase-out is spread across a wide income range) and becomes progressively gentler as income rises. The $200/month baseline payment does not taper at all -- it remains flat for all recipients below the clean exit threshold. There are no cliff effects: benefits decline smoothly and end cleanly at 10x FPL. Additional earnings always improve household financial position. The permanent disregard for SSI and TANF prevents the APSP from triggering cliff effects in those programs.

**Outcome: Smooth Work Incentives Replacing Poverty Traps.** The APSP eliminates the marginal tax rate spikes that trap households in poverty. At every income level, earning more results in keeping more. The logarithmic taper ensures that the effective phase-out rate never approaches the 50-70% rates that characterize current program overlaps. Workers can accept raises, additional hours, or better-paying positions without calculating whether they will lose more in benefits than they gain in wages. The permanent SSI and TANF disregard ensures that the most vulnerable populations -- those most exposed to cliff effects under current rules -- are protected from day-one harm. The design converts the political liability of work disincentives into a political asset: the APSP demonstrably rewards work at every income level.

### 8. Macroeconomic Procyclicality

**Status Quo Problem.** The American economy lacks adequate automatic stabilizers. When recessions hit, household income falls, consumer spending contracts, businesses cut investment and employment, and the cycle deepens. Federal unemployment insurance provides partial stabilization but reaches only workers who lose jobs through no fault of their own -- not those whose hours are cut, whose businesses fail, or who never had stable employment. State governments, facing revenue collapse, cut spending procyclically -- laying off public employees, reducing services, and deferring investment precisely when stimulus is most needed. Discretionary fiscal stimulus (like COVID relief) requires legislative action that takes months and is subject to political negotiation, reducing both speed and adequacy. The result is that recessions are deeper and longer than they need to be, imposing costs measured in lost output, household hardship, and long-term economic scarring.

**Act Mechanism.** The APSP functions as a powerful automatic stabilizer through its benefit formula. As household incomes fall during recessions, APSP payments automatically increase (more adults fall below the clean exit threshold; those already receiving payments see their income-adjusted component rise). This increased payment flow operates without any legislative action -- the formula responds to economic conditions in real time based on prior-year AGI. The Stability Buffer absorbs revenue fluctuations during downturns without reducing payments. State revenue sharing (20% of APC revenue) provides stable countercyclical resources to state governments, reducing the procyclical budget cuts that worsen recessions at the state level.

**Outcome: Built-In Countercyclical Stabilization.** The APSP injects purchasing power into the economy automatically when it is most needed -- during downturns when consumer spending is contracting. No Congressional action, no emergency legislation, no political negotiation required. Stable household income sustains consumer demand, which sustains business revenue, which sustains employment -- dampening the recessionary spiral. State revenue sharing reduces the procyclical austerity that state-level budget crises currently impose. The Stability Buffer ensures that APSP payments never decline during downturns, preventing the self-defeating cycle of cutting stabilization programs precisely when they matter most. The combined effect is an economy with structurally shorter, shallower recessions and faster recoveries.

## Part IV: The Aggregate Case

The status quo imposes costs that are enormous, ongoing, and compounding. Economic precarity among working-age adults -- the absence of the income floor that Social Security provides to retirees -- generates cascading consequences: reduced household formation, deferred education, suppressed geographic mobility, diminished labor market bargaining power, and political instability rooted in economic fear. The federal government's fragmented response through means-tested programs reaches only a fraction of those in need, imposes administrative costs on the populations least equipped to bear them, and creates work disincentives that trap households at critical income thresholds. When crises demand rapid cash delivery, the absence of standing infrastructure costs billions in improvised administrative systems and imposes weeks or months of delay on households in freefall. State governments, deprived of stable federal revenue sharing, impose procyclical austerity that deepens recessions and defers essential investment.

The Act's implementation costs are bounded and transitional. The Bridge Period requires approximately $900 billion over 24-30 months, funded through a hybrid of bounded deficit financing ($400 billion cap), progressive bridge taxes, and early APC collection. Bridge taxes sunset automatically. Bridge borrowing carries a statutory repayment obligation, estimated at 6-8 years from APC surplus. At steady state, the system is fully self-funding: the 12% APC generates approximately $1.56 trillion annually against program costs of approximately $1.12 trillion, with the surplus funding bridge loan repayment, Stability Buffer contributions, and fiscal cushion. The federal fiscal position at steady state is a surplus of approximately $130 billion -- the system costs taxpayers nothing after the Bridge Period.

The return on investment is asymmetric. A transitional investment of $900 billion -- comparable in scale to the $931 billion in COVID stimulus payments, but with superior fiscal architecture -- builds permanent infrastructure that delivers household stability to 241 million adults, stable revenue to 50 state governments, automatic macroeconomic stabilization, and the political constituency to sustain itself indefinitely. Each problem set in this analysis identifies a distinct dysfunction; each mechanism addresses that dysfunction through specific statutory provisions; each outcome represents measurable improvement over the status quo. The aggregate effect is greater than the sum of parts: economic stability enables democratic participation, democratic participation sustains the political will to maintain economic stability, and the self-reinforcing cycle replaces the current self-reinforcing cycle of precarity, fear, and institutional erosion.

Several benefits resist precise quantification but are substantial. Improved labor market bargaining for workers no longer trapped by desperation. Family formation decisions freed from financial survival calculations. Caregiver recognition through income support for the 53 million Americans providing unpaid care. Reduced demand for emergency services, payday lending, and crisis intervention. Shorter, shallower recessions through automatic stabilization. These outcomes compound over years and decades in ways that static cost-benefit analysis cannot fully capture.

The costs of inaction are not hypothetical. They are measured in the current data: half of adults without adequate savings, tens of millions in survival mode, state budgets that collapse during recessions, emergency payment systems rebuilt from scratch during every crisis, and political instability rooted in economic fear. The infrastructure does not build itself. The dysfunction does not resolve itself. The question is not whether the investment is justified but how much longer its absence can be sustained.
