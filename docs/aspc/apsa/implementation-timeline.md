# American Prosperity and Stability Act

## Implementation Timeline

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 4.8 of the American Prosperity and Stability Act

---

## Timeline Overview

The APSA implements through three distinct operational phases: the Bridge Period (transitional funding), the Phase-In Period (APC rate escalation), and Full Implementation (steady state). Benefits accrue from Day 1 and are delivered as rapidly as administrative infrastructure permits.

### Implementation Phases at a Glance

| Phase | Timeline | Funding Source | APSP Scale | Max Monthly Benefit | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Bridge Period** | Months 0-24 | Hybrid (deficit + bridge taxes + APC pre-collection) | 40% | ~$371 | Benefits accrue from Day 1; rapid deployment begins; bridge taxes active |
| **Launch** | Years 1-2 | APC at 6% | 40% | ~$371 | APC collection operational; Bridge Period ends; statutory payback begins |
| **Expansion** | Years 3-4 | APC at 9% | 69% | ~$495 | APC rate increase; APSP benefits scale up |
| **Full Implementation** | Year 5+ | APC at 12% | 100% | ~$628 | Full system operation; program consolidation evaluation may begin |

## Sequencing Requirements

### Hard Dependencies (Must Occur Before)

| Action | Must Precede | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Enactment | Benefit accrual | Legal authority required |
| IRS data access | Tax filer enrollment | Need eligibility verification |
| SSA coordination | SSA beneficiary enrollment | Need identity/payment data |
| Treasury rulemaking | APC collection | Businesses need compliance rules |
| APC operational | Bridge Period end certification | Self-funding requirement |

### Bridge Period Funding Dependencies

| Funding Component | Dependencies | Timeline |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| Bridge taxes | Enactment | Next quarter after enactment |
| Deficit borrowing | Enactment + Treasury authorization | Immediate |
| APC pre-collection | Treasury rulemaking | Month 12-18 |

### Soft Dependencies (Optimal But Not Required)

| Action | Optimally Precedes | Fallback If Unavailable |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| APNA operational | APSP payment delivery | Use existing Treasury systems (Direct Express, direct deposit) |

                    +---> State Treasury (all 50 states)
```

### Bridge Period Revenue Flow

Bridge Period Funding (~$900B total over 24 months)
       |
       +---> 40% Bounded Deficit (~$360B)
       |            |

                    v
              Early APC at 3-4% (Month 12-18 forward)
```

### Bridge Tax Structure

| Tax | Rate | Threshold |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Income Surtax | 2% | AGI > $100,000 / $200,000 |
| High-Income Add-On | 1% | AGI > $500,000 / $1,000,000 |
| Corporate Surtax | 4% | Taxable income > $1,000,000 |

**Sunset:** All bridge taxes terminate automatically upon Bridge Period end certification. No Congressional action required.

### Bridge Period End Certification

The Bridge Period ends when both conditions are met:

1. APC revenue funds APSP obligations for two consecutive quarters
2. Stability Buffer reaches minimum reserve level (6 months)

Upon certification, bridge taxes sunset and statutory payback begins.

### Statutory Payback

- Bridge Period Borrowing repaid from APC surplus after full implementation
- Priority below benefit payments, state revenue sharing, and administrative costs
- Priority above Stability Buffer contributions exceeding minimum
- Estimated retirement: 6-8 years following Bridge Period end

---

## Fiscal Safeguards

### Stability Buffer Operations

| Trigger | Response | Authority |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Buffer below 6-month minimum for 2 quarters | APC rate increases 0.25 points | Automatic |
| Automatic increases reach 2.0 points cumulative | Further increases require Congressional action | Congress |
| Buffer exceeds 12-month target for 4 quarters | Automatic rate increases reverse | Automatic |
| Buffer projected to exhaust within 18 months | Secretary notifies Congress | Solvency trigger |
| Congress does not act within 180 days of notification | Automatic rate increases beyond cap authorized | Default |

### Economic Stress Scenarios

**Recession During Implementation:**

- APSP payments never decline due to revenue shortfall
- Stability Buffer absorbs revenue gaps
- Automatic APC rate adjustments activate if needed
- APSP functions as automatic stabilizer (more eligible, higher payments)

**Rapid Inflation:**

- FPL thresholds automatically adjust annually (HHS)
- APSP benefits scale with FPL
- No Congressional action required

### Political Contingencies

**APNA Not Enacted:**

- Use existing Treasury payment systems (Direct Express, direct deposit, checks)
- Full standalone implementation viable but less efficient

**Implementation Interrupted:**

- Existing APC rate continues (no automatic escalation without Congressional action)
- APSP benefits continue at current scale
- Stability Buffer provides continuity
- System remains operational at whatever phase reached

## State Transparency and Reporting

### State Revenue Share Distribution

State revenue share is distributed by pure population share. Each state receives a percentage of total state revenue equal to its percentage of national population, as determined by the most recent Census Bureau estimates.

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Distribution basis | Population share (Census Bureau estimates) |
| Annual amount (full implementation) | ~$312 billion (20% of APC revenue) |
| Per-capita amount | ~$931/person |
| Flow | Deposited to state treasury |
| State control | Subject to normal state appropriation process |
| Federal conditions | None -- full state autonomy over allocation |

### State Reporting Requirements

States receiving APC revenue share must publish an annual State APC Revenue Report within 90 days of fiscal year close.

**Required content:**

1. Total APC revenue received during fiscal year
2. Allocation by functional category (education, transportation, public safety, health, general government, debt service, reserves, tax reduction, other)
3. Year-over-year comparison showing allocation changes
4. Narrative explanation of priorities and significant changes

**Format:** Standardized Treasury template enabling state-to-state comparison.

### Treasury Compilation Responsibilities

| Deliverable | Content | Timeline |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Reporting template | Uniform format with functional categories | Pre-enactment |
| National summary | Compilation of all state reports | Annual (within 60 days of state deadline) |
| Comparison tables | State-by-state allocation patterns | Annual |
| Public dashboard | Accessible interface for citizen review | Continuous |

### Enforcement Ladder for Non-Reporting

| Days After Deadline | Action | Penalty |
|---------------------|--------|---------|
| 1-30 | Technical assistance offered; written response required | None |
| 31-60 | 50% of distributions withheld (escrowed) | None if cured |
| 61+ | 100% of distributions withheld (escrowed) | None if cured |
| 180+ | 20% penalty on escrowed funds | Redistributed to compliant states |

**Cure provision:** States may cure non-compliance at any stage by filing compliant report. No penalty if filed within 60 calendar days of deadline.

**No escalation:** Each compliance cycle evaluated independently. New administrations not penalized for predecessor failures.

### State Transparency Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Milestone | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Pre-enactment | Draft reporting template and dashboard specifications | Before enactment |
| Bridge Period | Finalize template through state consultation | Months 1-6 |
| Launch | First state reports due (FY1) | ~15 months post-enactment |
| Steady State | Annual reporting cycle operational | Year 2+ |
