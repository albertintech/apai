# American Prosperity and Stability Act

## Establishing a Secure Economic Foundation for Every American

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 4.6 of the American Prosperity and Stability Act

---

The American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA) establishes monthly stability payments to American adults, creating an economic floor that prevents catastrophic descent during job loss, illness, or economic disruption. The legislation addresses a fundamental gap in American economic infrastructure: unlike peer nations, the United States provides no baseline income floor for working-age adults facing economic volatility.

APSA provides the American Prosperity Stability Payment (APSP), which combines a $200/month baseline available to approximately 90% of American adults with an income-adjusted stability component providing larger payments to lower-income households. Maximum payments reach $628/month for zero-income recipients. As income rises, the stability component phases out smoothly -- no benefit cliffs -- ensuring work always pays. At the clean exit threshold of approximately $150,600 (10x FPL), even the baseline phases out, but this affects only about one in ten American adults.

The American Prosperity Contribution (APC) funds the system at 12%. The APC is a contribution on goods and services collected at each stage of production and distribution. Twenty percent of APC revenue -- approximately $312 billion annually -- flows to state governments via pure population share, providing stable revenue with full state autonomy over allocation decisions.

## Key Components

- **American Prosperity Stability Payment (APSP)** -- Monthly income-adjusted payments providing economic stability. Combines a flat $200/month baseline with an income-adjusted stability component that phases out smoothly as income rises.

- **American Prosperity Contribution (APC)** -- Funds stability payments at 12% of domestic consumption. Creates a reciprocal relationship: everyone contributes through consumption, everyone benefits through stability payments.

- **State Revenue Sharing** -- Allocates 20% of APC revenue (~$312 billion annually) to states via pure population share. Annual transparency reporting enables citizen accountability without federal mandates on allocation.

- **Stability Buffer** -- Reserves a portion of revenue to maintain payment levels during economic downturns, preventing procyclical cuts when households need stability most.

- **Bridge Period Funding** -- Three-component hybrid mechanism (bounded deficit financing, bridge taxes, APC pre-collection) enables rapid deployment with benefits flowing within months of enactment rather than waiting years for full revenue collection.

- **Rapid Deployment Framework** -- Enrollment targets ensure 95% of tax filers receive payments within 90 days, with comprehensive outreach to non-filers through SSA coordination.
