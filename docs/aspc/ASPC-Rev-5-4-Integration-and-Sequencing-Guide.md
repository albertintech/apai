# American Shared Prosperity Compact

## Integration and Sequencing Guide

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 5.4 of the American Shared Prosperity Compact

---

## Executive Summary

The American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC), hereafter referred to as "the Compact," is a three-act legislative framework designed to build foundational economic infrastructure for American households across the lifecycle. Unlike traditional omnibus legislation, the Compact is designed with intentional modularity: each act delivers independent value while creating powerful synergies when combined.

The three components are:

1. **American Payment Network Act (APNA)** -- Payment infrastructure
2. **American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** -- Adult economic stability with integrated enrollment
3. **Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** -- Child investment and family security

This document explains how the three acts integrate, analyzes potential implementation pathways, and provides guidance on sequencing decisions based on both technical requirements and political realities.

**Key Principle:** The Compact is designed to work in any passage scenario -- all three together, any two in combination, or each standing alone. This resilience is deliberate, not accidental.

**What Changed:** The original Compact included the American Economic Participation Act (AEPA) for enrollment and civic integration. As of Rev 4.0, AEPA functions were consolidated into APSA Section 10 (Rapid Deployment and Enrollment). As of Rev 5.0, the Secure Our Children Act (SOCA) was elevated from companion legislation to full pillar status, completing a three-act framework that addresses economic security across the entire lifecycle.

---

## Section 1: Design Principles

The Compact is built on three core principles that enable flexible implementation while maintaining coherence.

### Principle 1: Modularity

Each act delivers tangible value on its own merits:

- APNA solves financial exclusion and modernizes federal payments
- APSA addresses adult economic precarity, stabilizes demand, and provides enrollment infrastructure
- SOCA invests in children and supports families during critical developmental periods

This means each act can pass independently, in different legislative sessions, under different political coalitions, even under different presidential administrations. The framework doesn't require ideological consensus -- only pragmatic recognition that each piece solves real problems.

### Principle 2: Integration-Ready Design

Each act is designed to integrate seamlessly when companion acts become available:

- APNA provides payment rails for both APSA and SOCA distribution
- APSA provides adult stability while SOCA addresses child-specific needs
- SOCA coordinates with APSA to prevent benefit clawbacks
- All three use "when available" conditional language

This creates adaptive legislation that responds to changing infrastructure availability.

### Principle 3: Lifecycle Coverage

The Compact provides economic security across the entire lifecycle:

- **Birth:** SOCA Birth Support Payment
- **Childhood:** SOCA monthly Child Stability Payment
- **Adulthood:** APSA American Prosperity Stability Payment
- **All ages:** APNA financial infrastructure

This comprehensive coverage reinforces the "everyone pays, everyone benefits" philosophy -- Americans contribute throughout their working lives and receive support when they need it most.

## Section 2: The Three Acts -- Functional Overview

### American Payment Network Act (APNA)

**Function:** Nationwide payment infrastructure
**Core Value Proposition:** Free digital accounts for all Americans

**What It Does:**

- Creates a national interoperable payment network
- Provides fee-free Network Accounts to every eligible person
- Establishes APN Agents (banks, credit unions, fintechs, USPS)
- Enables government benefit delivery without intermediary fees
- Provides banking access in "banking deserts"

**Standalone Benefits:**

- Financial inclusion for an estimated 20+ million unbanked Americans
- Reduced federal payment costs (eliminates check printing, prepaid card fees)
- Improved monetary transmission (faster stimulus delivery)
- Platform for state-level payment integration

**Integration Value:**

- Becomes payment rail for APSP distribution
- Becomes payment rail for SOCA Child Stability Payments and Birth Support Payments
- Receives account creation triggers from APSA Simple Form filing
- Provides secure identity infrastructure for future programs

**Political Profile:** Low controversy (infrastructure/"boring utility" framing)

---

### American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)

**Function:** Nationwide adult income stability floor with integrated enrollment
**Core Value Proposition:** Economic stability for all households

**What It Does:**

- Provides monthly stability payments to all eligible adults
- Funded by broad-based consumption contribution (APC at 12%)
- Uses two-component benefit structure (baseline $200/mo + income-adjusted stability payment)
- Covers ~90% of American adults (clean exit at 10x FPL / $150,600)
- Shares 20% of APC revenue with states via pure population share distribution
- Phases in gradually while maintaining existing programs
- Provides enrollment infrastructure through IRS filing and Simple Form for non-filers (Section 10)
- Coordinates with SSA for non-filer identification and outreach (Section 10)

**Standalone Benefits:**

- Economic security and stability for adult households
- Stable consumer demand for businesses
- Predictable state revenue (~$312 billion annually)
- Reduced economic precarity
- Streamlined enrollment for non-filers through Simple Form

**Integration Value:**

- Provides the compelling use case for APNA
- Creates massive political constituency
- Triggers APNA account creation for non-banked recipients
- Coordinates with SOCA to ensure child benefits don't reduce adult payments

**Political Profile:** Higher controversy initially (but transforms after passage into durable entitlement similar to Social Security)

---

### Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)

**Function:** Dedicated child investment and family support
**Core Value Proposition:** Every child supported from birth

**What It Does:**

- Provides monthly Child Stability Payment to families with children (age-tiered: higher for younger children)
- Provides $2,000 Birth Support Payment upon birth or adoption
- Funded by Child Security Contribution (1.50% of AGI + 3.00% kicker above $500k/$1M)
- No income-based phase-out -- the credit is for the child, not the parent
- Fully refundable -- benefits flow regardless of tax liability
- Safe harbor provisions protect families from overpayment clawbacks

**Standalone Benefits:**

- Dramatic reduction in child poverty
- Economic stability during critical developmental periods
- Birth support during vulnerable transition to parenthood
- Reduced food insecurity and housing instability for families with children

**Integration Value:**

- Complements APSA adult payments with child-specific support
- Uses APNA infrastructure for efficient payment delivery
- Creates family-focused constituency alongside adult APSP constituency
- Separate funding stream (Child Security Contribution) protects both programs' fiscal integrity

**Political Profile:** Moderate-to-favorable (child benefits have broad appeal; dedicated funding mechanism answers fiscal questions)

---

## Section 3: Bridge Period Funding (APSA)

A critical innovation in APSA is the Bridge Period funding framework, which solves the "chicken and egg" problem of getting stability payments flowing before APC revenue reaches steady state.

### The Problem

APSP payments must begin flowing within months of enactment to build political constituency and deliver economic benefits. But APC revenue requires:

- 12+ months for business implementation
- 18-24 months to reach Launch Phase rate (6%)
- 30+ months to reach steady state

This creates a ~24-30 month gap requiring approximately $900 billion in transitional funding.

### The Solution: Three-Component Hybrid

| Component | Share | Mechanism |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Bounded deficit | ~40% | Treasury borrowing with statutory payback |
| Progressive bridge taxes | ~30% | Temporary taxes on higher earners and corporations |
| APC pre-collection | ~30% | Early APC at 3-4% starting Month 12 |

### Bridge Tax Structure

- **Income surtax:** 2% on AGI above $100,000 (individual) / $200,000 (joint)
- **High-income add-on:** Additional 1% on AGI above $500,000 (individual) / $1,000,000 (joint)
- **Corporate surtax:** 4% on taxable income above $1,000,000

All bridge taxes sunset automatically when APC reaches Full Implementation.

### Statutory Payback

Bridge Period Borrowing (capped at $400 billion) must be repaid from APC surplus after steady state. This is not open-ended deficit spending -- it is a bridge loan that the program itself repays.

### Political Significance

The Bridge Period framework transforms APSA from a "long-term vision" into an "immediate delivery" program. Recipients experience monthly payments within 6-12 months of enactment, building political constituency before the next election cycle.

---

## Section 4: Rapid Deployment Framework (APSA)

APSA Section 10 establishes a rapid deployment framework that gets payments flowing quickly using existing infrastructure.

### Accrual from Day One

Benefits accrue for all eligible adults from the program's effective date, regardless of when enrollment is completed. Benefits are held in trust by Treasury until delivered; first payment includes all accrued amounts.

### Staggered Administrative Targets

| Population | Target | Infrastructure |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Tax filers with direct deposit | 90 days | IRS systems |
| Current SSA beneficiaries | 120 days | SSA payment systems |
| Non-filers with earnings history | 180 days | SSA outreach via W-2 records |
| Adults without tax/earnings records | 12 months | Community outreach, APN Agents |

### Simple Form for Non-Filers

Adults who don't file tax returns can establish eligibility through a one-page Simple Form requiring only:

- Identity verification
- Asset attestation ($5M threshold)
- Optional banking information (or Network Account request)

Simple Forms are available at SSA field offices, public libraries, post offices, online, and by mail.

### SSA Coordination

The Social Security Administration coordinates with Treasury to:

- Identify adults not in the tax filing system
- Provide outreach via last known addresses
- Offer in-person enrollment assistance at field offices
- Share data for non-filer identification (with privacy protections)

## Section 5: Technical Dependencies and Sequencing

### Technical Dependency Map

```text
APNA (Payment Infrastructure)
  |
  | enables efficient delivery to
  |
  +---> APSA (Adult Stability Payment + Enrollment)
  |       |
  |       | coordinates benefits with
  |       |
  +---> SOCA (Child Stability Payment + Birth Support)
          |
          | creates demand for
          v
        APNA (Payment Infrastructure)

APSA Section 10 (Simple Form filing)
  |
  | triggers account creation in
  v
APNA (Network Accounts)
```

**Key Insight:** No dependency is absolute. APSA and SOCA both include fallback mechanisms (existing Treasury systems, Direct Express) that operate without APNA.

### Optimal Technical Sequence

**If all three pass together or in rapid succession:**

**Phase 1 (Months 0-12): Parallel Foundation**

- APNA: Begin infrastructure buildout, certify APN Agents
- APSA: Bridge taxes take effect, rapid deployment begins
- SOCA: Child Security Contribution takes effect, payments begin
- First APSP and Child Stability Payments flow via existing systems

**Phase 2 (Months 12-24): Integration**

- APNA: Pilot programs operational
- APSA: APC pre-collection begins (3-4%)
- SOCA: Full enrollment stabilized
- Simple Form filers begin receiving Network Accounts

**Phase 3 (Months 24-36): Optimization**

- APNA: Nationwide digital rollout
- APSA: APC reaches Launch Phase rate (6%)
- All payments transition to Network Accounts where available

**Phase 4 (Year 5+): Maturity**

- APNA: Full infrastructure operational
- APSA: APC reaches Full Implementation (12%)
- Legacy program consolidation evaluated

---

## Section 6: Political Sequencing Strategies

### Strategy A: APSA First (Rapid Constituency Building)

The Bridge Period and rapid deployment frameworks fundamentally change the political calculus. APSA can now pass first because it:

- Delivers tangible benefits within months (not years)
- Creates massive adult constituency before next election
- Operates without APNA (though less efficiently)
- Builds demand for APNA and SOCA as follow-on legislation

**Best When:** You have votes for APSA but uncertain support for full Compact.

---

### Strategy B: SOCA First (Family Values Coalition)

Child benefits often attract broader political support than adult payments. SOCA first:

- Appeals to family-values conservatives and child welfare progressives
- Smaller fiscal footprint (~$257B/year vs. ~$1.56T for APSA) -- easier initial lift
- Creates family constituency that demands adult stability payments
- Builds infrastructure familiarity before larger APSA implementation

**Best When:** APSA faces fiscal opposition but child investment has bipartisan appeal.

---

### Strategy C: APNA First (Infrastructure Foundation)

**When This Works:**

- If both APSA and SOCA face fiscal opposition initially
- If "infrastructure first" has strongest political support
- If building payment foundation enables other acts later

**Stage 1: APNA Passes (Years 1-2)**

- Financial inclusion benefits
- Federal payment modernization
- Creates infrastructure baseline

**Stage 2: SOCA or APSA Passes (Years 3-4)**

- Infrastructure ready for efficient delivery
- "Now let's use it for stability payments"
- Integration from day one

---

### Strategy D: Simultaneous Passage (Omnibus)

**When This Works:**

- Strong unified government
- Sustained political mandate
- Coordinated implementation capacity

**Advantages:**

- Technically cleanest implementation
- Maximum integration from start
- Single political battle
- Complete lifecycle coverage from day one

---

## Section 7: Modular Scenarios

The Compact is designed to succeed in any combination. Below are the seven possible scenarios.

### Scenario 1: Full Compact (APNA + APSA + SOCA)

**Timeline:** 5-6 years from first passage to full integration

**Outcomes:**

- Complete lifecycle economic security
- Estimated 95%+ of eligible adults and children covered efficiently
- Financial inclusion for 20+ million unbanked Americans
- Maximum administrative efficiency through integrated infrastructure

**Political Durability:** Very High

---

### Scenario 2: APNA + APSA (No SOCA)

**Timeline:** 5-6 years to full integration

**Outcomes:**

- Adult economic stability achieved
- Payment infrastructure operational
- Child poverty addressed only through existing programs
- Creates demand for SOCA as "complete the picture" legislation

**Political Durability:** Very High for adults; incomplete for families

---

### Scenario 3: APNA + SOCA (No APSA)

**Timeline:** 4-5 years to full integration

**Outcomes:**

- Child investment achieved with efficient delivery
- Payment infrastructure operational
- Adult stability not addressed
- Creates demand for APSA from parents receiving child benefits

**Political Durability:** High; natural constituency expansion to adult payments

---

### Scenario 4: APSA + SOCA (No APNA)

**Timeline:** 3-5 years to steady state

**Outcomes:**

- Complete lifecycle benefits (adults + children)
- Delivered via existing Treasury/IRS infrastructure
- Higher administrative costs
- Some coverage gaps in banking deserts

**Workarounds:**

- Expand Direct Express program
- Partner with community banks and credit unions

**Political Durability:** Very High (massive combined constituency)

---

### Scenario 5: APSA Only

**Timeline:** 3-5 years to steady state

**Outcomes:**

- Primary adult stability goal achieved
- Delivered via existing systems
- Higher administrative costs than with APNA
- Child poverty addressed only through existing programs

**Future Path:** Success creates demand for both APNA (efficiency) and SOCA (completeness)

**Political Durability:** Very High

---

### Scenario 6: SOCA Only

**Timeline:** 2-3 years to full operation

**Outcomes:**

- Child poverty dramatically reduced
- Birth support stabilizes new families
- Delivered via IRS refundable credit infrastructure
- Adult stability not addressed

**Future Path:** Family constituency demands adult payments; builds case for APSA

**Political Durability:** High

---

### Scenario 7: APNA Only

**Timeline:** 3-4 years to full operation

**Outcomes:**

- Financial inclusion for estimated 20+ million Americans
- Modern government payment delivery
- Platform ready for future programs
- No stability payments

**Future Path:** Infrastructure becomes "obviously ready" when political window opens

**Political Durability:** Medium-High

---

## Section 8: Implementation Pathway Summary

### If You Control the Agenda

**Recommended:** Simultaneous passage (APNA + APSA + SOCA)

- Technical optimization
- Single political battle
- Complete lifecycle coverage

### If Political Environment Is Uncertain

**Recommended Priority Order:**

1. **APSA** (creates strongest adult constituency via rapid deployment)
2. **SOCA** (creates family constituency; may have broader appeal)
3. **APNA** (builds infrastructure foundation; lowest controversy)

### If Facing Strong Opposition

**Opportunistic Approach:**

- Pass whichever act has strongest support
- Each creates foundation and constituency for others
- Long game: any act builds toward full Compact

---

## Section 9: Coalition Building

### APNA Coalitions

**Natural Supporters:**

- Financial inclusion advocates
- Postal unions (USPS role)
- Community banks and credit unions
- Fintech companies (Agent opportunities)
- State governments (payment modernization)
- Federal agencies (cost savings)

**Potential Opposition:**

- Large banks (competitive concern) -- countered by Agent revenue opportunities
- Anti-government expansion voices -- countered by utility/infrastructure framing

**Winning Message:** "Modern payment infrastructure for all Americans"

---

### APSA Coalitions

**Natural Supporters:**

- Labor unions (member economic security)
- Anti-poverty organizations
- Small business (stable consumer demand)
- State governments (20% revenue share)
- Entrepreneurs (security enables risk-taking)

**Potential Opposition:**

- Fiscal conservatives (cost) -- countered by APC revenue, bridge payback, and economic multiplier
- Traditional welfare opponents -- countered by nationwide/earned framing

**Winning Message:** "Your fair share of the prosperity you help create"

---

### SOCA Coalitions

**Natural Supporters:**

- Child welfare organizations
- Family-values advocates (both progressive and conservative)
- Pediatric health organizations
- Education advocates
- Anti-poverty groups
- Religious organizations focused on family support

**Potential Opposition:**

- Fiscal conservatives (cost) -- countered by dedicated Child Security Contribution
- Those opposing refundable credits to non-filers -- countered by "all children deserve support" framing

**Winning Message:** "Every child deserves a strong start"

---

## Section 10: Risk Factors and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Infrastructure buildout delays
**Mitigation:** Rapid deployment uses existing systems; APNA integration is optimization, not requirement

**Risk:** Enrollment gaps for hard-to-reach populations
**Mitigation:** SSA coordination; community partnerships; remediation triggers; benefits accrue from day one

**Risk:** SOCA/APSA coordination complexity
**Mitigation:** Explicit statutory cross-references; Treasury regulation authority; child benefits don't reduce adult payments

### Political Risks

**Risk:** Change in political control before steady state
**Mitigation:** Rapid deployment creates constituency within first year; multiple constituencies (adults, families) harder to attack

**Risk:** "VAT tax" attacks on APC
**Mitigation:** Contribution framing; stability payment terminology; Social Security analogy

**Risk:** "Child Security Contribution" attacks
**Mitigation:** Shared responsibility framing; "everyone pays, everyone benefits"; modest rates (1.50% for most families)

### Economic Risks

**Risk:** Inflation from combined payments
**Mitigation:** Both programs funded by contributions (not money creation); demand-side effects offset by contribution mechanisms

**Risk:** Fiscal sustainability concerns
**Mitigation:** Each program has dedicated funding stream; automatic adjustment mechanisms maintain solvency

---

## Section 11: Measuring Success

### APNA Success Metrics

- Account uptake rate (target: 95%+ of eligible population within 5 years)
- Transaction costs (target: <0.05% of value)
- Service availability (target: 99.9% uptime)
- Banking desert coverage (target: 100% of underserved zip codes)

### APSA Success Metrics

- Enrollment rate (target: 95%+ of eligible adults within 2 years)
- Rapid deployment targets met (90/120/180 days/12 months)
- Adult poverty reduction (target: 50%+ reduction in deep poverty within 5 years)
- Economic security measures (emergency savings rates, financial stress indicators)
- Bridge Period Borrowing retirement (target: 6-8 years post-Bridge Period)

### SOCA Success Metrics

- Child enrollment rate (target: 98%+ of eligible children within 2 years)
- Child poverty reduction (target: 60%+ reduction in child poverty within 3 years)
- Deep child poverty reduction (target: 80%+ reduction within 3 years)
- Birth Support Payment uptake (target: 95%+ of eligible births within 2 years)
- Food insecurity reduction among families with children

### Integrated System Success

**Primary Measure:** Reduction in economic precarity across the lifecycle

The Compact succeeds when:

- Economic precarity declines measurably for both adults and children
- Household stability improves across income quartiles
- The infrastructure functions reliably and efficiently
- Political support remains durable across electoral cycles

---

## Section 12: Conclusion

The Compact is designed for political reality, not ideal conditions.

### Core Strategic Insights

1. **Modularity enables resilience.** Each act can pass independently, fail independently, or succeed together. No single legislative battle determines the outcome.

2. **Lifecycle coverage strengthens the case.** APNA provides infrastructure, APSA provides adult stability, SOCA provides child investment. Together they tell a complete story of shared prosperity.

3. **Rapid deployment transforms political calculus.** APSA delivers tangible benefits within months, not years. SOCA builds on established refundable credit infrastructure. Constituency building happens before the next election.

4. **Separate funding streams protect all programs.** APC funds APSA. Child Security Contribution funds SOCA. Neither competes with the other for resources.

5. **Multiple coalitions are stronger than one.** APNA attracts infrastructure advocates. APSA attracts labor and anti-poverty groups. SOCA attracts family-values voices. Combined, opposition is fragmented.

### The Framework Succeeds If:

- All three acts pass -- optimal outcome
- Any two acts pass -- substantial progress
- Any single act passes -- foundation for the others

That flexibility is the point.
