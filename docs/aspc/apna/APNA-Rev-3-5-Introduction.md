# American Payment Network Act

## Nationwide Digital Payment Infrastructure for Every American

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 3.5 of the American Payment Network Act

---

The American Payment Network Act (APNA) establishes a national, interoperable payment network providing every American with access to secure, fee-free digital accounts. The legislation addresses a fundamental infrastructure gap: according to the FDIC, approximately 5.6 million U.S. households remain entirely unbanked, while an additional 19 million households are underbanked, relying on costly alternative financial services.

The American Payment Network (APN) operates as a utility-style infrastructure, providing core financial services without the fees that burden low-income households. The network is digital-first, accessible through mobile applications, web portals, and ATMs, with physical access points added progressively through partnerships with the U.S. Postal Service and certified private institutions. This approach ensures nationwide coverage without requiring construction of new federal facilities.

APNA solves real problems regardless of whether companion legislation passes. Unbanked Americans gain reliable access to the financial system. Government payments -- tax refunds, Social Security, veterans benefits -- can reach recipients faster and at lower cost. When integrated with the American Prosperity and Stability Act, APNA provides the infrastructure for efficient delivery of stability payments to every eligible household.

## Key Components

- **Network Accounts** -- Fee-free digital accounts administered by Treasury, providing direct deposit, bill pay, transfers, and debit access. Accounts integrate with existing private banking; users can link preferred institutions or use the Network Account as their primary account.

- **APN Agents** -- Banks, credit unions, fintech companies, and U.S. Postal Service facilities can become certified agents providing account access and services. This distributed model ensures geographic coverage while enabling private institutions to continue competing for customers.

- **Technology-Neutral Access** -- Multiple access pathways including smartphone apps, web browsers, feature phone SMS/USSD, ATM networks, and in-person services ensure no American is excluded based on device ownership or technical capability.

- **American Payment Network Fund** -- Self-capitalizing infrastructure with Treasury borrowing authority eliminates appropriations dependency, ensuring continuous operation during government shutdowns or appropriations lapses.

- **USPS Integration** -- Priority partnership with the U.S. Postal Service establishes APN access points at post offices nationwide, prioritizing banking deserts, rural communities, and low-income urban neighborhoods.
