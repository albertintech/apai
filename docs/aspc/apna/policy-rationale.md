# American Payment Network Act

## Policy Rationale

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 3.7 of the American Payment Network Act

---

## Legislative Intent and Context

The **American Payment Network Act (APNA)**, hereafter referred to as "the Act," is the foundational infrastructure reform of the Economic Reforms portfolio. Its goal is simple but transformational: to guarantee every American access to the basic plumbing of the modern economy -- a secure, fee-free digital account connected to a national payments backbone.

## I. Rationale

### 1. Economic Participation as a Right

In the twenty-first century, participation in the economy requires digital access. Yet more than twenty million Americans remain unbanked or underbanked, paying predatory fees for check-cashing, money orders, or short-term credit. The Act ensures that no American is excluded from basic financial participation because of geography, income, institutional barriers, or age. From working teenagers to seniors on fixed incomes, every person gains access to the financial infrastructure necessary for modern economic life.

### 2. From "Bank" to "Utility"

The Act reframes public financial infrastructure as a utility, not a competitor. It does not displace private banks or fintech firms; it connects them. Like the interstate highway system or the public internet backbone, the network provides nationwide access, interoperability, and reliability on which private innovation can thrive. This neutral framing removes ideological opposition that doomed earlier "public banking" efforts.

### 3. Competitive Displacement of Predatory Practices

The Act solves the problem of financial exploitation through competition rather than regulation. Instead of writing ever-more-detailed rules to constrain predatory behavior -- rules that sophisticated actors game, evade, or litigate -- the Act introduces a market participant without profit motive, making predation economically unviable.

When a free, reliable alternative exists, exploitative practices lose their customer base:

- **Check-cashing services** charging 3-5% become obsolete when people can deposit instantly for free
- **Payday lending** at 400% APR collapses when desperation borrowing is unnecessary
- **Overdraft fees** disappear when accounts don't have overdrafts by design
- **Wire transfer fees** of $25-50 cannot compete with instant zero-cost transfers
- **ATM fees** face pressure when Network Accounts offer free access
- **Remittance services** charging 5-10% must adapt when near-cost alternatives emerge

This approach effectively supersedes volumes of well-intentioned but fragile financial regulation. Rather than prohibiting exploitation through law -- which requires enforcement, invites legal challenges, and remains vulnerable to political erosion -- the Act makes exploitation unprofitable. Banks and fintech firms can still offer premium services, rewards programs, and investment products, but they cannot charge predatory fees when a free baseline alternative exists.

The result is **market-driven consumer protection**: stable, robust, and immune to regulatory capture. This isn't ideological; it's pragmatic. Markets work when genuine competition exists. The Act provides that competition.

### 4. Foundation for Broader Economic Stability

The Act is the technical precondition for seamless implementation of the **American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** and other nationwide payment programs. It provides the Treasury and states with real-time, low-cost rails for direct deposits, refunds, and stability payments, replacing ad-hoc systems that generate errors, delays, and fraud risk. In the larger architecture, the Act plays the same role for economic security that the interstate grid plays for transportation.

Critically, the Act is designed as **self-capitalizing infrastructure**. The American Payment Network Fund, established within Treasury, receives revenues from network transaction fees, interest earnings, certification fees, and state cost-sharing payments. This dedicated funding stream eliminates dependence on annual appropriations, ensuring that critical payment infrastructure cannot be held hostage to budget negotiations or continuing resolution gaps. Treasury borrowing authority provides initial capitalization, with mandatory repayment from operational revenues -- the network pays for itself.

### 5. Fiscal and Monetary Efficiency

By modernizing the government's payment operations, the Act strengthens both fiscal delivery and monetary transmission. It allows automatic stabilizers -- like the Prosperity Stability Payment -- to reach households instantly during downturns and to retract smoothly during recoveries. It reduces the need for crisis legislation, temporary stimulus checks, and emergency appropriations.

The self-funding model reinforces this efficiency. Transaction fees capped at five basis points (0.05%) generate sustainable operating revenue without burdening users or participating institutions. Interest earnings on settlement balances and Fund reserves provide additional revenue streams. The result is infrastructure that improves government fiscal operations while requiring no ongoing taxpayer subsidy after initial deployment.

Most importantly, the Act's emergency operational authority ensures that payment infrastructure continues functioning during government shutdowns, appropriations lapses, or debt ceiling crises. When other federal operations may pause, the American Payment Network keeps running -- protecting both government benefit distribution and private-sector payment flows that depend on network availability.

### 6. Democratic and Civic Benefits

Economic exclusion undermines civic participation. A nationwide payments account becomes a gateway to engagement: annual filing, voting registration, and program enrollment can all flow through one verified identity system. The Act therefore links economic inclusion to democratic renewal without coercion.

### 7. Youth Financial Inclusion and Capability Building

The Act's comprehensive framework for minor accounts (Section 4A) ensures that young Americans -- including working teens, foster youth, and vulnerable populations -- gain safe access to the digital economy. By providing age-appropriate account access with built-in protections against financial abuse, the Act enables youth to build financial capability while participating in wage-earning activities. This early inclusion establishes patterns of financial stability and reduces barriers to adult economic participation.

## II. Alternatives Considered

Several approaches to financial exclusion have been proposed or attempted. The Act's design reflects deliberate choices among them.

### 1. Strengthened Regulation of Existing Banks

One approach would mandate that banks offer free basic accounts, cap overdraft fees, or require service in underserved areas. The Community Reinvestment Act follows this model for lending. The limitation is structural: regulatory approaches require ongoing enforcement, invite litigation, and remain vulnerable to political erosion. Banks subject to pricing regulations have historically responded by eliminating unprofitable product lines rather than serving unprofitable customers. The Act's competitive-displacement approach achieves the same consumer protection outcomes without depending on enforcement capacity or rulemaking durability. Regulation constrains behavior; infrastructure changes incentives.

### 2. Direct Government Banking (FedAccounts / Postal Banking)

Several proposals would have the federal government operate as a full-service bank -- offering savings accounts, small-dollar loans, and credit products through the Federal Reserve or USPS. The Act deliberately avoids this model. A government bank competes directly with private institutions, triggering organized opposition from the banking industry. It also requires the government to make credit allocation decisions -- a function poorly suited to bureaucratic administration. The Act's utility framework provides payment infrastructure without lending, credit, or investment functions. This narrower scope is both more defensible politically and more appropriate to the government's institutional strengths.

### 3. Expanding Existing Programs (Direct Express, Bank On)

The Treasury's Direct Express prepaid debit card program and the Bank On certification initiative represent incremental approaches. Direct Express serves approximately 3.4 million federal benefit recipients but is limited to benefit disbursement, carries some fees, and does not support general-purpose payments. Bank On certifies private bank accounts meeting baseline standards but depends on voluntary bank participation and does not address geographic access. These programs demonstrate demand and feasibility but cannot achieve nationwide coverage or serve as infrastructure for broader programs like APSA. The Act builds on their experience while solving the structural limitations they cannot overcome.

### 4. Market Evolution

Digital payment adoption has grown significantly, and some argue that private innovation -- mobile wallets, neobanks, peer-to-peer apps -- will solve financial exclusion over time. This argument overlooks two realities. First, private solutions optimize for profitability, not coverage; populations that are expensive to serve remain underserved. Second, private payment systems are fragmented, proprietary, and carry fees that fall disproportionately on low-income users. Market evolution has not produced and will not produce fee-free, nationwide, interoperable payment infrastructure available as a matter of right. Public infrastructure fills gaps that private markets do not find profitable to close -- the same principle that justified rural electrification, the interstate highway system, and the postal service.

## III. Addressing Concerns

### 1. Government Overreach

The Act creates payment infrastructure, not a government bank. It does not make loans, allocate credit, manage investments, or offer financial advice. The utility framework is the operative concept: the government builds and operates the network; private institutions provide front-end services. This is the same model as FedNow, the Federal Reserve's real-time payment service -- backbone infrastructure that private banks use. The Act extends this principle to individual account access.

### 2. Financial Privacy

A government-operated payment network raises legitimate questions about surveillance. The Act addresses these through several mechanisms: Section 4A establishes explicit privacy protections for vulnerable populations, including confidential account access for domestic abuse survivors and foster youth. Appendix A flags data-sharing limits, judicial oversight for law enforcement access, and audit trail retention as regulatory priorities. The Act does not grant Treasury surveillance authority beyond existing anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism-financing statutes that already apply to all financial institutions. Network Accounts are subject to the same legal protections as existing bank accounts -- not fewer.

### 3. Taxpayer Cost and Fiscal Risk

The self-capitalizing model addresses this concern directly. Treasury borrowing authority provides initial funding, with mandatory repayment from network revenues within 15 years. Transaction fees capped at five basis points fund ongoing operations. No annual appropriation is required. Congressional notification triggers at 50% and 75% of borrowing authority ensure transparency about cost trajectory. This is not a novel approach -- the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and elements of the Postal Service operate with similar funding independence. The Act applies the same principle: infrastructure too important to interrupt should not depend on processes that routinely interrupt.

### 4. Implementation Capacity

Federal technology projects have a mixed record. The Act mitigates this risk through three design choices. First, the digital-first approach leverages existing FedNow infrastructure rather than building from scratch. Second, the pilot program in five diverse states tests systems before nationwide commitment. Third, private-sector APN Agents provide front-end services -- the government builds the backbone; institutions with customer-facing experience handle the interface. The USPS partnership similarly leverages existing physical infrastructure rather than constructing a parallel network.

### 5. Competitive Impact on Private Institutions

The Act does not compete with banks for their profitable business lines -- lending, credit cards, wealth management, commercial banking. It provides baseline payment services that most banks consider low-margin or loss-leading. Banks that serve primarily affluent customers face minimal disruption. Banks that depend heavily on overdraft fees and maintenance charges on low-balance accounts face competitive pressure -- but from a free alternative, not from regulation. The APN Agent framework offers participating institutions a new revenue stream (regulated service fees) in exchange for connecting to the network. The net competitive effect is analogous to what happened when the interstate highway system was built: it didn't destroy trucking companies; it gave them better roads.

## IV. Relationship to Other Reforms

| Reform | Relationship to the Act | Sequencing |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| **American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** | Uses the Act as its secure distribution platform. Includes integrated enrollment functions (APSA Section 10) that rely on the network's nationwide account system. | Implemented immediately after network activation. |
| **Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** | Delivers child benefits through the same payment infrastructure. | Parallel or subsequent to APSA. |
| **Fairness in Income Tax Act (FIT Act)** | Provides upstream revenue fairness that feeds the APC mechanism supporting APSA. | Parallel / subsequent. |
| **National Land Value Tax Act (NLVTA)** | May use the network for land-based remittances and conservation disbursements. | Later phase. |

Together, these measures form an **American Shared Prosperity Compact** -- a three-pillar framework:

- APNA -- the payment infrastructure;
- APSA -- adult economic stability with integrated enrollment;
- SOCA -- child investment.

The FIT Act and NLVTA serve as companion legislation providing upstream fairness and additional funding mechanisms.

## V. Principles of Design

1. **Nationwide coverage** -- every person, every dollar, every transaction can travel through the same secure network.
2. **Neutrality** -- government acts as operator of infrastructure, not allocator of credit.
3. **Transparency** -- fees, uptime, and access metrics are public and auditable.
4. **Interoperability** -- open APIs allow private innovation atop the public grid.
5. **Resilience** -- redundancy and cybersecurity standards on par with federal critical-infrastructure systems.
6. **Protection** -- age-appropriate safeguards for vulnerable populations, including youth, ensure access without exploitation.
7. **Self-sustainability** -- dedicated funding mechanisms ensure operational continuity independent of annual appropriations cycles, with transparent repayment of initial capitalization from network revenues.

## VI. Expected Outcomes

- **Financial Inclusion:** 100% of U.S. households gain access to fee-free payment accounts.
- **Youth Financial Capability:** Working minors, foster youth, and young adults develop financial literacy and stability through early, protected account access.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** Savings on check issuance, fraud, and error correction across federal programs.
- **Macroeconomic Stability:** Faster stimulus transmission and smoother recovery cycles.
- **Small-Business Enablement:** Nationwide, low-cost digital payments reduce barriers for entrepreneurs.
- **Fiscal Resilience:** Self-funding infrastructure eliminates appropriations risk and ensures continuous operation during government disruptions.
- **Public Trust:** Transparency and reliability reinforce confidence in federal institutions.

## VII. Summary Statement

> *The American Payment Network Act treats payment access the way the New Deal treated electricity access -- as a public utility that empowers private enterprise and secures democratic life.*
>
> **Infrastructure for money. Access for everyone. Stability for the nation.**
