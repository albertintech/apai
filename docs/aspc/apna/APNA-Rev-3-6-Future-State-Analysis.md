## Future State Analysis

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 3.6 of the American Payment Network Act

---

This document maps the causal chain from identified dysfunction in the American financial access system to the specific legislative mechanisms in the American Payment Network Act (APNA), hereafter referred to as "the Act," and the expected outcomes those mechanisms produce. Data and claims are drawn from the Act's legislative text, Policy Rationale, Implementation Timeline, and Constituency Impact Analysis. The analysis is organized by problem set rather than legislative structure.

## Part I: Structural Overview

### The Status Quo

The United States operates the world's largest economy without guaranteeing its residents access to the basic payment infrastructure that economy requires. Approximately 5.6 million households (4.2%) have no bank account. Another 19 million households (14.2%) are underbanked -- they hold accounts but still rely on expensive alternative financial services for basic needs. These populations pay hundreds of dollars annually in check-cashing fees, money order costs, overdraft charges, and payday lending interest for services that the banking system provides to wealthier customers at no cost or minimal cost. Financial exclusion rates are significantly higher among low-income households, households with disabilities, Black and Hispanic families, and single-parent households.

Federal payment operations -- wages, benefits, tax refunds, stimulus disbursements -- rely on a patchwork of legacy systems (direct deposit, paper checks, Direct Express cards) with no unified infrastructure. Government programs cannot reach recipients who lack bank accounts without incurring significant administrative cost and delay. There is no public payment infrastructure comparable to the highway system, postal system, or electric grid.

### The Future State

The Act establishes the American Payment Network (APN) -- a nationwide, utility-style digital payment infrastructure operated by the Treasury Department. Every lawful U.S. resident gains access to a fee-free Network Account with no minimum balance, no overdraft fees, and no credit check. Financial institutions participate as APN Agents earning regulated service fees. The U.S. Postal Service provides physical access points. The network is self-capitalizing through a dedicated Fund, eliminating dependence on annual appropriations. The system operates continuously, including during government shutdowns.

## Part II: Problem Set, Mechanism, and Outcome Analysis

### 1. Financial Exclusion of Unbanked Households

**Status Quo Problem.** Approximately 5.6 million U.S. households have no bank account, according to the FDIC's 2023 National Survey. These households cannot receive direct deposit of wages, cannot pay bills electronically, cannot shop online, and cannot receive government benefits efficiently. They rely on check-cashing services charging 3-5% of check value, money orders costing $1-5 per transaction, and in-person bill payment requiring time and travel. An unbanked household typically spends $200-300 annually on fees for basic financial services that banked households receive at no cost. The root causes -- minimum balance requirements, overdraft fee exposure, credit check barriers, geographic inaccessibility -- are structural features of the private banking system, not individual failures.

**Act Mechanism.** Section 5(a) guarantees every lawful U.S. resident the right to hold a fee-free Network Account. Section 5(b) prohibits minimum balance requirements, maintenance fees, and overdraft fees. Section 5(c) establishes technology-neutral access through smartphones, web browsers, feature phones, ATMs, and in-person services. Section 5(g) creates an Unbanked Access Program with in-person onboarding assistance, alternative identity verification, and financial literacy grants.

**Outcome: Elimination of Involuntary Financial Exclusion.** When a fee-free, no-barrier account exists as a matter of right, the structural causes of involuntary exclusion are removed. The 5.6 million unbanked households gain access to direct deposit, electronic payments, and digital commerce. Annual fee savings of $200-300 per household represent approximately $1.1-1.7 billion returned to the lowest-income Americans.

### 2. Predatory Fee Extraction from Underbanked Households

**Status Quo Problem.** Approximately 19 million households are underbanked -- they hold bank accounts but still use expensive alternative services. Check-cashing, payday lending (often at 400%+ APR), overdraft programs, and high-fee wire transfers extract billions annually from populations who can least afford it. Regulatory approaches to curbing these practices face persistent challenges: rules are gamed, litigated, captured, or politically eroded. The underlying market failure is not insufficient regulation but insufficient competition -- exploitative services thrive because captive customers lack alternatives.

**Act Mechanism.** The Act introduces a zero-fee market participant (the APN) that makes predation economically unviable through competition rather than regulation. Section 5(b) guarantees no-fee accounts that eliminate overdraft exposure. Section 5(f) guarantees fee-free cash access, removing ATM fee burden. Section 4(e) establishes regulated service fees for APN Agents, creating price transparency. The APN does not prohibit predatory services -- it makes them unprofitable by providing a superior free alternative.

**Outcome: Market-Driven Consumer Protection.** When a reliable, free baseline exists, exploitative pricing loses its customer base. Check-cashing services charging 3-5% cannot compete with instant free deposit. Payday lending demand declines as desperation borrowing becomes unnecessary. Overdraft fee revenue erodes as no-overdraft accounts become the default. This competitive displacement is more durable than regulation because it does not depend on enforcement, rulemaking, or political will to maintain.

### 3. Geographic Banking Deserts

**Status Quo Problem.** Bank branch closures have accelerated nationwide, disproportionately affecting rural communities, low-income urban neighborhoods, and communities of color. Residents of banking deserts may travel significant distances for basic financial services -- depositing a check, withdrawing cash, or opening an account. The USPS operates approximately 31,000 facilities nationwide including in communities where banks have closed, but these facilities currently provide no banking services. The federal government maintains no geographic coverage standard for financial access.

**Act Mechanism.** Section 4(d) prioritizes USPS facilities as APN access points, targeting banking deserts, rural communities, and low-income urban neighborhoods. USPS-based access points provide cash services, in-person onboarding, account terminals, and multilingual support. Section 4(d)(2) authorizes purpose-built APN service centers where USPS coverage is insufficient. Section 5(d) establishes a 90% population proximity standard for access. Section 5(g)(5) requires a public, searchable registry of all access points coordinated with major mapping services.

**Outcome: Nationwide Physical Access Through Existing Infrastructure.** The USPS partnership leverages 31,000 existing facilities to deliver banking services without constructing a parallel branch network. Banking deserts gain physical access points within their communities. The 90% proximity standard creates an enforceable coverage guarantee -- something that does not exist in the current system. The public registry ensures that access points are discoverable through tools people already use.

### 4. Device-Dependent Digital Exclusion

**Status Quo Problem.** Digital banking increasingly assumes smartphone ownership and broadband access. Approximately 15% of Americans do not own a smartphone. Broadband adoption gaps persist in rural areas, tribal lands, and low-income communities. Feature phone users -- disproportionately elderly, rural, and low-income -- are effectively locked out of digital financial services. Existing fintech solutions and most banking apps require smartphone installation or reliable broadband.

**Act Mechanism.** Section 5(c) establishes a technology-neutral access guarantee. Section 5(c)(2) explicitly prohibits denying access due to lack of smartphone, broadband, or computing device ownership. Section 5(c)(3) mandates that all critical account functions -- balance inquiry, transaction history, payment initiation, and account freeze -- are available via SMS on feature phones, with USSD evaluation for cost-free alternatives. Section 5(c)(4) integrates public libraries and community centers as secure APN web portal access points.

**Outcome: Financial Access Independent of Device Ownership.** Every access channel -- smartphone, browser, feature phone, ATM, debit card, in-person -- reaches the full account. A senior with a flip phone can check their balance and send a payment via text message. A rural resident without broadband can use their local library or post office. No technology barrier stands between a person and their money.

### 5. Youth Financial Exclusion and Vulnerability

**Status Quo Problem.** Minors generally cannot open bank accounts without parental consent and participation. Working teenagers aged 16-17 who earn wages may have no independent access to banking. Foster youth aging out of care lack family infrastructure for financial onboarding. Homeless youth cannot meet standard identification and address requirements. Minors fleeing domestic abuse cannot establish financial independence without alerting abusers. These barriers delay financial capability building and leave vulnerable young people dependent on cash economies or exploitative adults.

**Act Mechanism.** Section 4A establishes a comprehensive framework. Section 4A(a) grants independent account access to youth aged 16 and older without parental consent. Section 4A(b) provides accounts for working minors under 16 with parental consent and joint visibility. Section 4A(c) guarantees independent access for emancipated minors, foster youth, homeless youth, and domestic abuse survivors -- including alternative identity verification processes and confidential account services. Section 4A(d) establishes enhanced privacy protections with prohibitions on financial abuse. Section 4A(f) requires Treasury to develop age-tiered regulations in consultation with HHS and child welfare agencies.

**Outcome: Safe Financial Onboarding for Every Young American.** Working teens gain direct access to their wages. Foster youth aging out of care have accounts ready. Homeless youth can receive payments without a permanent address. Abuse survivors can establish financial independence without notification to abusers. Age-appropriate protections prevent exploitation while enabling capability building. The transition to adult accounts at age 18 is automatic and seamless.

### 6. Fragmented Federal Payment Delivery

**Status Quo Problem.** The federal government delivers payments through multiple disconnected systems: direct deposit for tax refunds and wages, paper checks for those without bank accounts, Direct Express cards for certain benefit recipients, and ad-hoc mechanisms for emergency disbursements like stimulus payments. Each system has its own enrollment process, delivery timeline, and failure modes. During COVID-19 stimulus disbursement, millions of payments were delayed by weeks or months because the government had no reliable way to reach recipients who lacked direct deposit information. Every emergency payment program requires rebuilding delivery infrastructure from scratch.

**Act Mechanism.** Section 4(f) establishes the APN as a unified platform supporting direct deposit of wages, benefits, refunds, and authorized public programs including the American Prosperity Stability Payment. Section 4(a-b) places administration under a single Office of Digital Payment Infrastructure within Treasury, with Federal Reserve settlement services. The network's real-time payment capability and universal account coverage mean that any authorized payment can reach any eligible person instantly.

**Outcome: Unified Payment Infrastructure for All Federal Programs.** One network, one account system, one delivery mechanism. Tax refunds, benefit payments, and emergency disbursements flow through the same infrastructure. When the next crisis requires rapid payment to all Americans, the infrastructure exists and accounts are already open. Administrative costs for payment delivery decline as redundant systems consolidate. The APN also serves as the distribution platform for APSA stability payments and SOCA child benefits, eliminating the need for each program to build its own delivery system.

### 7. Appropriations Vulnerability of Critical Infrastructure

**Status Quo Problem.** Federal programs dependent on annual appropriations are vulnerable to government shutdowns, continuing resolution gaps, and debt ceiling crises. Payment infrastructure that serves millions of Americans should not be subject to political disruption, yet most federal operations pause during shutdowns. The risk is not hypothetical -- the government has shut down four times since 2013, with the longest lasting 35 days in 2018-2019.

**Act Mechanism.** Section 8(a) establishes the American Payment Network Fund as a dedicated funding vehicle available without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation. Section 8(b) provides Treasury borrowing authority of up to $15 billion for initial capitalization, repayable from network revenues. Section 8(c-d) establish ongoing revenue streams -- transaction fees capped at five basis points, interest earnings, certification fees, and state cost-sharing payments. Section 8(h) explicitly authorizes continued operations from Fund balances during government shutdowns, appropriations lapses, or debt ceiling crises.

**Outcome: Self-Sustaining Infrastructure Immune to Political Disruption.** The network funds itself from operational revenue. Initial borrowing is repaid within 15 years. No annual appropriation is required. When the government shuts down, the APN keeps running. This is not a novel model -- the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and Postal Service all operate with varying degrees of appropriations independence. The Act applies the same principle to payment infrastructure: services too important to interrupt should not depend on processes that routinely interrupt them.

## Part IV: The Aggregate Case

The status quo imposes quantifiable costs. Unbanked households spend approximately $1.1-1.7 billion annually on fees for basic financial services. The underbanked population spends additional billions on alternative financial services. Government administrative costs for fragmented payment delivery systems -- paper checks, multiple enrollment processes, emergency disbursement mechanisms -- run into the hundreds of millions. The costs of delayed emergency payments during crises, while difficult to quantify precisely, are measured in economic disruption and human hardship.

The Act's implementation costs are bounded and transitional. Treasury borrowing authority is capped at $15 billion, with mandatory repayment from network revenues within 15 years. Transaction fees capped at five basis points fund ongoing operations. After the repayment period, the network operates from revenue with a six-month reserve -- infrastructure that sustains itself indefinitely.

The return on investment is asymmetric. A one-time investment of up to $15 billion -- repaid from operations, not taxpayer funds -- eliminates billions in annual predatory fee extraction, creates permanent infrastructure for efficient federal payment delivery, and provides the distribution backbone for the broader American Shared Prosperity Compact. Every future program that needs to deliver money to Americans benefits from infrastructure that already exists.

Several benefits resist quantification but are substantial. Financial inclusion strengthens civic participation. Youth financial capability reduces long-term dependence. Geographic access equity addresses a rural-urban divide that carries political as well as economic consequences. Continuous operation during government shutdowns protects institutional credibility.

The costs of inaction are ongoing and compounding. Every year without universal payment infrastructure is another year that 5.6 million households pay fees they cannot afford for services that should be free, another year that emergency payment systems must be rebuilt from scratch, another year that programs like the APSP cannot reach every eligible American efficiently. The infrastructure does not build itself. The dysfunction does not resolve itself. The question is not whether the investment is worthwhile but how much longer the absence of it can be sustained.
