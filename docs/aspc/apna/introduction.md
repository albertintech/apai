# American Payment Network Act

## Policy Introduction

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 3.7 of the American Payment Network Act

---

The American Payment Network Act (APNA) establishes a nationwide, utility-style digital payment infrastructure that guarantees every American access to a secure, fee-free account for receiving and sending money. The Act addresses a basic gap in American economic life: participation in the modern economy requires access to digital payment systems, yet according to the FDIC's 2023 National Survey, approximately 5.6 million U.S. households have no bank account at all, and another 19 million are underbanked -- relying on check-cashing stores, payday lenders, and money orders that drain hundreds of dollars annually from those who can least afford it. These burdens fall disproportionately on low-income households, households with disabilities, and Black and Hispanic families.

APNA creates the American Payment Network (APN) -- public digital infrastructure operated by the Treasury Department that connects existing financial institutions, the U.S. Postal Service, and new digital access points into a single interoperable system. Like the interstate highway system or rural electrification, the APN provides essential infrastructure on which private innovation can operate. Banks, credit unions, and fintech providers participate as APN Agents, earning regulated service fees while their customers retain fee-free access. The network is self-capitalizing: an American Payment Network Fund within Treasury receives revenue from transaction fees, interest earnings, and certification fees, repaying initial Treasury borrowing from operational revenues within fifteen years. No ongoing taxpayer cost is required, and operations continue uninterrupted during government shutdowns.

APNA serves as the foundational infrastructure for the broader American Shared Prosperity Compact. The American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA) uses the network as its distribution platform for monthly stability payments, and the Secure Our Children Act (SOCA) delivers child benefits through the same system.

## Key Components

- **Network Accounts** -- Fee-free digital accounts with no minimum balance, no overdraft fees, and no credit check. Every lawful U.S. resident is eligible regardless of income, employment status, or credit history. Physical debit cards provided at no cost.

- **Technology-Neutral Access** -- Accounts accessible through smartphones, web browsers, feature phones (SMS/USSD), ATMs, debit cards, and in-person services. No one is excluded based on the technology they own.

- **Open Participation for Financial Institutions** -- Banks, credit unions, and fintechs connect to the network as APN Agents (Full-Service or Digital), earning regulated service fees comparable to FedNow/ACH pricing. No additional fees may be imposed on basic accounts.

- **USPS Partnership** -- Post offices serve as APN access points, bringing in-person banking services to rural communities and urban neighborhoods where bank branches have closed. Purpose-built service centers fill remaining gaps.

- **Protections for Vulnerable Populations** -- Independent account access for youth ages 16+, working minors, foster youth, homeless youth, and domestic abuse survivors, with privacy safeguards and age-appropriate protections against financial exploitation.

- **Self-Capitalizing Funding** -- The American Payment Network Fund provides dedicated financing through Treasury borrowing authority ($15 billion cap) repaid from network revenues. Transaction fees capped at five basis points. Emergency operational authority ensures continuous operation during government disruptions.

- **Nationwide Cash Access** -- Fee-free cash deposits and withdrawals guaranteed through Full-Service Agents, ATM networks, and retail partnerships. Geographic coverage standards ensure 90% of the population has access within reasonable proximity.
