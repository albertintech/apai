# THE AMERICAN PAYMENT NETWORK ACT (APNA)

## Establishing Nationwide Digital Payment Infrastructure for Every American

### Revision 3.6

---

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the **"American Payment Network Act"** or **"APNA."**

---

## SECTION 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.

### (a) Purpose.
To establish a national, interoperable, utility-style payments network providing every American with access to secure, low-cost electronic accounts for receiving and sending funds; to modernize federal payment systems; and to ensure nationwide participation in the digital economy.

### (b) Findings.
Congress finds that --
1. Access to digital payment systems is essential to participation in modern economic life;
2. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's 2023 National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, approximately 5.6 million U.S. households (4.2 percent) remain unbanked, and an additional 19 million households (14.2 percent) are underbanked, with significantly higher rates among households including individuals with disabilities, low-income households, and certain racial and ethnic minority groups;
3. The federal government already operates large-scale payment infrastructure (Treasury, Federal Reserve, USPS) that can be integrated into a single public network;
4. A nationally interoperable payments network will promote financial inclusion, reduce transaction costs, improve efficiency of public transfers, and strengthen monetary transmission;
5. Nationwide access requires technology-neutral design that supports smartphones, feature phones, web browsers, ATMs, and in-person services without creating barriers based on device ownership or technical capability; and
6. The creation of the **American Payment Network (APN)** advances the nation's economic security and supports implementation of programs such as the **American Prosperity Stability Payment (APSP)**.

---

## SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

For purposes of this Act:
1. **American Payment Network (APN)** means the nationwide electronic payment and settlement infrastructure established under this Act, providing real-time clearing and settlement among participating institutions.
2. **Network Account** means a secure, fee-free digital account made available to every eligible individual and business through APN nodes.
3. **Participating Institution** or **APN Agent** means any financial entity, credit union, fintech provider, or public node authorized by the Treasury to connect to the APN.
4. **Full-Service APN Agent** means an APN Agent that provides direct cash handling services through physical locations (including banks with branches, credit unions, and designated USPS facilities).
5. **Digital APN Agent** means an APN Agent that provides account services primarily through digital channels and satisfies cash access requirements through ATM networks, retail partnerships, or fee reimbursement mechanisms.
6. **Utility Framework** means a governance model ensuring neutrality, interoperability, and non-discriminatory access, comparable to public utilities in communications or power transmission.
7. **Treasury Node** means the Treasury Department's operational division responsible for network oversight, compliance, and settlement integrity.
8. **Banking Desert** means a geographic area, as defined by the Secretary, with limited or no access to traditional banking services, considering factors including physical branch proximity, ATM availability, population density, and transportation access.

## SECTION 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AMERICAN PAYMENT NETWORK.

### (a) Creation.
There is hereby established within the Department of the Treasury a public digital-payments infrastructure to be known as the **American Payment Network (APN)**.

### (b) Governance.
1. The Secretary of the Treasury shall administer the Network through the **Office of Digital Payment Infrastructure (ODPI)**.
2. An **Advisory Board** of nine members -- representing Treasury, the Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Postal Service, community financial institutions, consumer protection agencies, and public representatives -- shall advise on standards, security, and access.
3. The Network shall operate under a **utility charter**, guaranteeing neutrality, interoperability, transparency, and non-discriminatory access.

### (c) Digital-First Rollout.
1. The APN shall launch as a **digital-first network**, accessible through web portal, mobile application, and automated-teller-machine interfaces.
2. Physical access points shall be added progressively as resources permit and as population needs warrant, prioritizing the U.S. Postal Service infrastructure before new construction.
3. Digital infrastructure shall reach full national coverage before new purpose-built physical facilities are required.

### (d) Physical Infrastructure Strategy.
1. **Priority One: U.S. Postal Service Integration**
   (A) The Secretary of the Treasury shall enter into agreements with the United States Postal Service to establish APN access points at post offices nationwide, prioritizing Banking Deserts, rural communities, and low-income urban neighborhoods.

   (B) USPS facilities designated as APN access points shall provide:
       (i) Cash deposit and withdrawal services;
       (ii) In-person account onboarding assistance;
       (iii) Account access terminals;
       (iv) Multilingual support where community demographics warrant.

   (C) The Secretary shall negotiate compensation arrangements with USPS that ensure cost recovery while maintaining service accessibility.

2. **Priority Two: Purpose-Built APN Service Centers**
   (A) Where USPS infrastructure is insufficient to meet access needs, the Secretary may establish APN service centers designed for high-traffic community access and minimal operating costs.

   (B) The Secretary shall develop evaluation criteria for service center location and design, prioritizing co-location with existing public services (libraries, municipal offices, community centers) and considering Banking Desert determinations, cost efficiency, and community needs.

   (C) Service centers shall not compete with or duplicate existing bank branches; they serve only areas with demonstrated access gaps.

3. **Phased Buildout Timeline**
   (A) Phase 1 (Years 1-2): USPS partnership agreements and digital infrastructure deployment;
   (B) Phase 2 (Years 3-5): Targeted service center construction in remaining Banking Deserts where USPS coverage is insufficient;
   (C) Phase 3 (Years 5+): Ongoing maintenance, accessibility improvements, and coverage expansion as needed.

### (e) Open-Network Participation.
1. Any regulated financial institution, credit union, or approved fintech provider may serve as an **APN Agent**, offering front-end account services connected to the Treasury-operated APN backbone.
2. The Treasury shall issue participation standards for cybersecurity, Know-Your-Customer compliance, and interoperability.
3. Agents may collect a **regulated service fee**, negotiated and published annually by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, comparable to utility-access fees under FedNow or ACH pricing schedules.
4. No APN Agent may impose additional maintenance or overdraft fees on basic APN accounts.

### (f) Scope of Service.
The APN shall:
1. Provide digital payment accounts to every individual with a valid Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number;
2. Support direct deposit of wages, benefits, refunds, and authorized public programs including the **American Prosperity Stability Payment (APSP)**;
3. Enable real-time person-to-person and business-to-business transfers;
4. Maintain interoperability with private systems (ACH, FedNow, card networks) via open-API architecture; and
5. Comply with all applicable anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism-financing statutes.

### B. Privacy, Security, and Data Management
3. What statutory limits on data sharing between Treasury, IRS, and participating institutions are needed to preserve civil liberties?
4. Should cybersecurity standards mirror FedNow protocols, adopt bespoke federal-cloud architecture, or exceed current industry standards?

6. How should the APN handle law enforcement data requests? What judicial oversight is required?

### C. Physical Infrastructure and USPS Integration
7. What specific compensation structure for USPS ensures sustainability without imposing excessive costs on the APN system?
8. Should USPS employees receive specialized training and compensation for APN services, or should APN-specific staff be stationed at postal facilities?
9. What minimum service standards (hours, staffing, language access) should apply to USPS-based APN access points?

### D. Access Technology and Feature Phones
10. How should SMS reimbursement be administered to minimize burden while ensuring fairness? Should there be caps or automatic approval thresholds?
11. Should USSD be prioritized over SMS given its cost-free nature, and what technical barriers exist to USSD implementation in the U.S. market?
12. What happens to feature phone access if carriers phase out 3G networks? What contingency plans are needed?

### E. Cash Access and Agent Networks
13. What minimum ATM network size or coverage standards should Digital APN Agents meet (e.g., "40,000+ ATMs nationwide")?
14. Should automatic ATM fee reimbursement by Digital Agents be subject to transaction limits or caps to prevent abuse?
15. What standards should govern retail cash-handling partnerships (security, liability, training, insurance)?
