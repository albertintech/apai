# SECURE OUR CHILDREN ACT (SOCA)

## A Bill to Establish a Permanent, Fully Refundable, Monthly Child Tax Credit and Birth Support Payment to Strengthen American Family Economic Security

### Published January 2026

---

**To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a permanent, fully refundable, monthly Child Tax Credit; to provide a one-time Birth Support Payment to families upon the birth or adoption of a child; to establish the Child Security Contribution to fund these benefits on a sustainable basis; to strengthen economic security for American families with children; to coordinate with the American Prosperity and Stability Act; and for other purposes.**

---

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the "Secure Our Children Act" or "SOCA."

## SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### (a) Findings

Congress finds that:

1. A monthly, fully refundable child allowance reduces child poverty and food insecurity, improves family cash flow, and stabilizes household finances through economic shocks.

2. The tax code should support children regardless of parental earnings in a given month or year.

3. A shared contribution from all Americans -- proportional to income -- provides fair, sustainable, and politically durable funding for child benefits while reinforcing the principle that every citizen has a stake in the well-being of the next generation.

4. Administrative experience from 2021 demonstrated the feasibility of advance monthly payments, while also revealing the need for improved outreach to non-filers and robust safe harbors.

5. Making the credit permanent, inflation-indexed, and simple to claim creates durable anti-poverty effects and reduces bureaucratic friction.

6. Research demonstrates that household income declines significantly around childbirth, with average declines exceeding 10 percent during the birth month and single mothers experiencing earnings drops of approximately 31 percent in the months surrounding birth.

7. The first months of a child's life are critical for development, and economic instability during this period creates lasting harm to child outcomes.

8. A one-time birth support payment provides timely, flexible assistance that allows families to address their unique circumstances during a pivotal period in their child's life.

9. Family economic security is a foundational element of a prosperous democracy and complements the infrastructure established by the American Shared Prosperity Compact.

10. Children do not choose their parents or their family's economic circumstances; support for children should not be conditioned on parental income level.

### (b) Purposes

The purposes of this Act are to:

1. Establish a permanent, fully refundable, monthly child tax credit pegged to child age.

2. Remove earnings phase-ins that exclude the poorest children.

3. Provide a one-time birth support payment to stabilize household finances during the economically vulnerable birth period.

4. Coordinate with APSA so that credit amounts and birth support payments do not reduce American Prosperity Stability Payment benefits.

5. Establish a Child Security Contribution -- a modest, universal income-based contribution from all Americans -- to fund child benefits on a sustainable, fiscally responsible basis.

6. Require transparent reporting, strong error-reduction, and accessible enrollment for non-filers and the un/underbanked.

1. **Code** means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

2. **Secretary** means the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate.

3. **Qualifying child** has the meaning given in section 152(c) of the Code, except as modified by this Act.

5. **Birth Support Payment** means the one-time payment provided under Section 4A upon the birth or legal adoption of a qualifying child.

6. **Gestational parent** means an individual who is or was pregnant with a qualifying child, including an individual acting as a gestational surrogate.

7. **Expected due date** means the date on which a child is expected to be born, as certified by a licensed physician, nurse-midwife, or other qualified healthcare provider.

2. The Secretary shall provide income-based installment agreements for any remaining balance due.

### (e) Age and Eligibility

The credit applies to children under age 18. The Secretary shall prescribe rules for newborns, changes in custody, and mid-year moves to minimize gaps in payment.
