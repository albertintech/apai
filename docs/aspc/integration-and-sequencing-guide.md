A Modular Approach to Economic Stability Across Generations

---

## Executive Summary

The American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC), hereafter referred to as "the Compact," is a three-act legislative framework designed to build foundational economic infrastructure for American households across the lifecycle. Unlike traditional omnibus legislation, the Compact is designed with **intentional modularity**: each act delivers independent value while creating powerful synergies when combined.

The three components are:

1. **American Payment Network Act (APNA)** -- Payment infrastructure
2. **American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** -- Adult economic stability with integrated enrollment
3. **Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** -- Child investment and family security

This document explains how the three acts integrate, analyzes potential implementation pathways, and provides guidance on sequencing decisions based on both technical requirements and political realities.

**Key Principle:** The Compact is designed to work in ANY passage scenario -- all three together, any two in combination, or each standing alone. This resilience is deliberate, not accidental.

**What Changed:** The original ASPC included the American Economic Participation Act (AEPA) for enrollment and civic integration. As of Rev 4.0, AEPA functions were consolidated into APSA Section 10 (Rapid Deployment and Enrollment). As of Rev 5.0, the Secure Our Children Act (SOCA) is elevated from companion legislation to full pillar status, completing a three-act framework that addresses economic security across the entire lifecycle.

---

## Section 1: Design Principles

The Compact is built on three core principles that enable flexible implementation while maintaining coherence.

### Principle 1: Modularity

Each act delivers tangible value on its own merits:

- APNA solves financial exclusion and modernizes federal payments
- APSA addresses adult economic precarity, stabilizes demand, and provides enrollment infrastructure
- SOCA invests in children and supports families during critical developmental periods

This means each act can pass independently, in different legislative sessions, under different political coalitions, even under different presidential administrations. The framework doesn't require ideological consensus -- only pragmatic recognition that each piece solves real problems.

### Principle 2: Integration-Ready Design

Each act is designed to integrate seamlessly when companion acts become available:

- APNA provides payment rails for both APSA and SOCA distribution
- APSA provides adult stability while SOCA addresses child-specific needs
- SOCA coordinates with APSA to prevent benefit clawbacks
- All three use "when available" conditional language

This creates **adaptive legislation** that responds to changing infrastructure availability.

### Principle 3: Lifecycle Coverage

The Compact provides economic security across the entire lifecycle:

- **Birth:** SOCA Birth Support Payment
- **Childhood:** SOCA monthly child benefits
- **Adulthood:** APSA American Prosperity Stability Payment
- **All ages:** APNA financial infrastructure

This comprehensive coverage reinforces the "everyone pays, everyone benefits" philosophy -- Americans contribute throughout their working lives and receive support when they need it most.

## Section 2: The Three Acts -- Functional Overview

### American Payment Network Act (APNA)

**Function:** Nationwide payment infrastructure
**Core Value Proposition:** Free digital accounts for all Americans

**What It Does:**

- Creates a national interoperable payment network
- Provides fee-free Network Accounts to every eligible person
- Establishes APN Agents (banks, credit unions, fintechs, USPS)
- Enables government benefit delivery without intermediary fees
- Provides banking access in "banking deserts"

**Standalone Benefits:**

- Financial inclusion for an estimated 20+ million unbanked Americans
- Reduced federal payment costs (eliminates check printing, prepaid card fees)
- Improved monetary transmission (faster stimulus delivery)
- Platform for state-level payment integration

**Integration Value:**

- Becomes payment rail for APSP distribution
- Becomes payment rail for SOCA child benefits and Birth Support Payments
- Receives account creation triggers from APSA Simple Form filing
- Provides secure identity infrastructure for future programs

**Political Profile:** Low controversy (infrastructure/"boring utility" framing)

---

### American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)

**Function:** Nationwide adult income stability floor with integrated enrollment
**Core Value Proposition:** Economic stability for all households

**What It Does:**

- Provides monthly stability payments to all eligible adults
- Funded by broad-based consumption contribution (APC at 12%)
- Uses two-component benefit structure (baseline $200/mo + income-adjusted stability payment)
- Covers ~90% of American adults (clean exit at 10x FPL / ~$150,600)
- Shares 20% of APC revenue with states via pure population share distribution
- Phases in gradually while maintaining existing programs
- **Provides enrollment infrastructure** through IRS filing and Simple Form for non-filers (Section 10)
- **Coordinates with SSA** for non-filer identification and outreach (Section 10)

**Standalone Benefits:**

- Economic security and stability for adult households
- Stable consumer demand for businesses
- Predictable state revenue (~$312 billion annually)
- Reduced economic precarity
- Streamlined enrollment for non-filers through Simple Form

**Integration Value:**

- Provides the compelling use case for APNA
- Creates massive political constituency
- Triggers APNA account creation for non-banked recipients
- Coordinates with SOCA to ensure child benefits don't reduce adult payments

**Political Profile:** Higher controversy initially (but transforms after passage into durable entitlement similar to Social Security)

---

### Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)

**Function:** Dedicated child investment and family support
**Core Value Proposition:** Every child supported from birth

**What It Does:**

- Provides monthly child benefits to families with children ($300/month under 6; $250/month ages 6-17)
- Provides $2,000 Birth Support Payment upon birth or adoption
- Funded by Child Security Contribution (1.50% of AGI + 3.00% kicker above $500k/$1M)
- No income-based phase-out -- the credit is for the child, not the parent
- Fully refundable -- benefits flow regardless of tax liability
- Safe harbor provisions protect families from overpayment clawbacks

**Standalone Benefits:**

- Dramatic reduction in child poverty
- Economic stability during critical developmental periods
- Birth support during vulnerable transition to parenthood
- Reduced food insecurity and housing instability for families with children

**Integration Value:**

- Complements APSA adult payments with child-specific support
- Uses APNA infrastructure for efficient payment delivery
- Creates family-focused constituency alongside adult APSP constituency
- Separate funding stream (Child Security Contribution) protects both programs' fiscal integrity

**Political Profile:** Moderate-to-favorable (child benefits have broad appeal; dedicated funding mechanism answers fiscal questions)

---

## Section 3: Bridge Period Funding (APSA)

A critical innovation in APSA is the Bridge Period funding framework, which solves the "chicken and egg" problem of getting stability payments flowing before APC revenue reaches steady state.

### The Problem

APSP payments must begin flowing within months of enactment to build political constituency and deliver economic benefits. But APC revenue requires:

- 12+ months for business implementation
- 18-24 months to reach Launch Phase rate (6%)
- 30+ months to reach steady state

This creates a ~24-30 month gap requiring approximately $900 billion in transitional funding.

### The Solution: Three-Component Hybrid

| Component | Share | Mechanism |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Bounded deficit | ~40% | Treasury borrowing with statutory payback |
| Progressive bridge taxes | ~30% | Temporary taxes on higher earners and corporations |
| APC pre-collection | ~30% | Early APC at 3-4% starting Month 12 |

### Bridge Tax Structure

- **Income surtax:** 2% on AGI above $100,000 (individual) / $200,000 (joint)
- **High-income add-on:** Additional 1% on AGI above $500,000 (individual) / $1,000,000 (joint)
- **Corporate surtax:** 4% on taxable income above $1,000,000

All bridge taxes sunset automatically when APC reaches Full Implementation.

### Statutory Payback

Bridge Period Borrowing (capped at $400 billion) must be repaid from APC surplus after steady state. This is not open-ended deficit spending -- it is a bridge loan that the program itself repays.

### Political Significance

The Bridge Period framework transforms APSA from a "long-term vision" into an "immediate delivery" program. Recipients experience monthly payments within 6-12 months of enactment, building political constituency before the next election cycle.

---

## Section 4: Rapid Deployment Framework (APSA)

APSA Section 10 establishes a rapid deployment framework that gets payments flowing quickly using existing infrastructure.

### Accrual from Day One

Benefits accrue for all eligible adults from the program's effective date, regardless of when enrollment is completed. Benefits are held in trust by Treasury until delivered; first payment includes all accrued amounts.

### Staggered Administrative Targets

| Priority Tier | Target Timeline | Population | Mechanism |
|---------------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 | 90 days | Tax filers with direct deposit | IRS auto-enrollment from most recent return |
| Tier 2 | 120 days | Current SSA beneficiaries | SSA data matching |
| Tier 3 | 180 days | Non-filers with earnings history | SSA outreach + Simple Form |
| Tier 4 | 12 months | Remaining adults | Community outreach, libraries, post offices |

### Simple Form (Non-Filer Enrollment)

One-page form requiring only:

- Identity verification
- Asset attestation ($5 million threshold)
- Optional banking information (or Network Account request)

Available at SSA field offices, public libraries, post offices, online, and by mail.

### Political Significance

Rapid deployment creates political fait accompli: by the time opposition organizes, millions of Americans are already receiving monthly checks. Repealing an active benefit with visible monthly payments is vastly harder than blocking a theoretical program.

## Section 5: Technical Dependency Map

### Hard Dependencies (Required for Function)

| Feature | Depends On | Without It |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| APSP payments | IRS/Treasury (existing) | Cannot operate |
| Child benefits | IRS (existing) | Cannot operate |
| Network Accounts | APNA passage | Use existing bank/Treasury systems |
| APN Agent network | APNA passage + private participation | Use USPS + digital-only |

### Soft Dependencies (Enhances but Not Required)

| Feature | Enhanced By | Standalone Alternative |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| APSP delivery speed | APNA Network Accounts | Existing direct deposit + checks |
| Non-filer enrollment | APNA identity infrastructure | SSA + Simple Form |
| Child payment delivery | APNA | IRS direct deposit + Direct Express cards |
| SOCA benefit coordination | APSA | IRS standalone administration |

### Key Integration Points

**APNA + APSA:**

- APSA Simple Form triggers Network Account creation for unbanked filers
- Network Accounts become default APSP delivery channel
- APNA identity verification supplements APSA enrollment

**APNA + SOCA:**

- Network Accounts enable faster child benefit delivery
- Birth Support Payments route through Network Accounts
- APNA infrastructure supports non-filer portal access

**APSA + SOCA:**

- SOCA benefits excluded from APSA income calculations
- APSA enrollment infrastructure identifies families with children
- Shared IRS administration reduces overhead

**All Three:**

- Unified enrollment experience
- Single payment infrastructure
- Coordinated income calculations
- Maximum administrative efficiency

---

## Section 6: Implementation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full Compact (All Three Together)

**Political Conditions:** Large legislative majority, strong executive support, favorable economic moment

**Advantages:**

- Maximum synergy from Day 1
- Unified messaging and constituency building
- Most efficient use of administrative resources
- Complete lifecycle coverage immediately

**Risks:**

- Largest fiscal footprint invites strongest opposition
- Implementation complexity across three simultaneous rollouts
- Single legislative failure kills everything

**Mitigation:** Bridge Period funding, phased APC implementation, and rapid deployment framework reduce implementation risk. Modular statutory design means partial implementation succeeds even if full integration is delayed.

### Scenario 2: APSA First (Adult Stability Priority)

**Political Conditions:** Strong populist momentum, focus on working-class economic security

**Advantages:**

- Largest immediate impact (90% of adults)
- Creates massive constituency for subsequent acts
- Bridge Period framework enables immediate payments
- State revenue sharing builds federalism support

**Risks:**

- Largest fiscal footprint of the three acts
- APC implementation complexity without companion infrastructure
- Child policy advocates may feel deprioritized

**Timeline:** APSA Year 1 -> SOCA Year 2-3 -> APNA Year 3-4

### Scenario 3: SOCA First (Child Investment Priority)

**Political Conditions:** Bipartisan child poverty concern, smaller fiscal window, family-values coalition

**Advantages:**

- Smallest fiscal footprint (~$257B vs ~$1.56T)
- Builds on 2021 CTC expansion precedent
- Cross-ideological appeal (child welfare)
- Creates family constituency for broader reform

**Risks:**

- Doesn't address adult economic precarity directly
- CSC implementation requires new administrative infrastructure
- May reduce pressure for broader reform if seen as sufficient

**Timeline:** SOCA Year 1 -> APSA Year 2-3 -> APNA Year 3-4

### Scenario 4: APNA First (Infrastructure Foundation)

**Political Conditions:** Low-controversy window, infrastructure-focused agenda, bipartisan opportunity

**Advantages:**

- Lowest controversy and fiscal impact
- Creates infrastructure foundation for APSA and SOCA
- Demonstrates government competence
- Bipartisan appeal (financial inclusion, postal banking)

**Risks:**

- Smallest immediate constituency impact
- "Boring" infrastructure may not sustain political momentum
- Benefits less visible without companion payment programs

**Timeline:** APNA Year 1 -> APSA or SOCA Year 2-3 -> Remaining act Year 3-5

---

## Section 7: Political Sequencing Strategy

### Coalition Building by Act

**APNA Coalition:**

- Financial inclusion advocates
- Consumer protection organizations
- Rural advocacy groups (banking deserts)
- Postal worker unions
- Fintech industry (new market)
- Anti-poverty organizations

**APSA Coalition:**

- Labor unions
- Anti-poverty organizations
- Business groups (stable consumer demand)
- State governments (revenue sharing)
- Fiscal conservatives (dedicated funding, no deficit)
- Rural advocates (per-capita distribution benefits rural states)

**SOCA Coalition:**

- Child welfare organizations
- Religious organizations (child poverty)
- Early childhood advocates
- Pediatric medical associations
- Education advocacy groups
- Pro-family organizations across ideological spectrum

### Opponent Analysis

**Potential Opposition:**

| Opponent | Concern | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Anti-tax groups | APC as new tax | "Contribution, not tax" -- funded system that returns value |
| Financial industry | APNA competition | APN Agent model creates new revenue; doesn't replace banking |
| Welfare reform advocates | Work disincentive | Income-adjusted design rewards work; evidence supports |
| Deficit hawks | Fiscal sustainability | Self-funding with surplus; bridge payback statutory |
| States' rights advocates | Federal overreach | 20% state share with zero mandates |

### Messaging Framework

**Universal:** "Everyone pays, everyone benefits"
**For adults:** "Your economic floor"
**For families:** "Every child invested in"
**For states:** "Your money, your decisions"
**For business:** "Stable customers, predictable demand"

---

## Section 8: Cross-Act Coordination Provisions

### Income Calculation Coordination

**APSA treatment of SOCA benefits:**

- SOCA child benefits are **excluded** from AGI for APSP calculation
- Birth Support Payment is **excluded** from AGI for APSP calculation
- This prevents child benefits from reducing adult stability payments

**SOCA treatment of APSA benefits:**

- APSP is **excluded** from income calculations for SOCA purposes
- This prevents stability payments from affecting child benefit eligibility

**Means-tested program coordination:**

- APSP is **disregarded** for SSI and TANF (cliff-effect programs)
- APSP is **counted** for SNAP, Medicaid, and housing (graduated programs)
- SOCA benefits carry 12-month income disregard for all federal means-tested programs

### Administrative Coordination

**Shared infrastructure:**

- IRS serves as primary administrative platform for both APSA and SOCA
- SSA provides non-filer identification and outreach for both
- Treasury provides payment delivery for all three acts
- APNA provides account infrastructure for all payment streams

**Data sharing:**

- APSA enrollment triggers SOCA eligibility verification for filers with children
- SOCA enrollment provides child data for APSA household calculations
- APNA account status shared across programs for payment routing

## Section 9: Risk Analysis

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| APC implementation delays | Medium | High | Bridge Period provides 24-30 month buffer |
| Non-filer enrollment shortfall | Medium | Medium | SSA outreach, community partnerships, accrual from Day 1 |
| APNA infrastructure delays | Medium | Low | Existing Treasury systems as fallback |
| State resistance to APC | Low | Medium | 20% revenue sharing creates state advocates |
| Benefit calculation errors | Low | Medium | Safe harbor provisions; phased rollout |

### Political Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Repeal attempt after passage | Medium | High | Constituency effects make repeal politically costly |
| Partial passage (1-2 acts only) | High | Low | Each act designed for standalone viability |

| Inter-program competition | Low | Medium | Separate funding streams prevent competition |

### Economic Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Recession during implementation | Medium | High | Bridge Period flexibility; automatic stabilizers |
| Inflation concerns | Low-Medium | Medium | Revenue-funded, not money creation; gradual phase-in |
| Labor market disruption | Low | Low | Evidence shows stability increases participation |
| Revenue shortfall | Low | Medium | Automatic adjustment mechanisms in both APC and CSC |

## Section 10: Legal and Constitutional Considerations

### APC Legal Foundation

The APC is structured as an excise tax on domestic consumption, well within Congressional taxing power under Article I, Section 8. Similar mechanisms (excise taxes on specific goods, payroll taxes) have withstood constitutional scrutiny for over a century.

### Child Security Contribution Legal Foundation

The CSC is structured as an income-based contribution (similar to payroll taxes), well within established Congressional authority.

### State Revenue Sharing

Distribution of APC revenue to states via population share formula uses Congress's spending power. Pure population share distribution avoids equal protection concerns that could arise from needs-based formulas.

### APNA Structural Foundation

Treasury's authority to establish payment systems is well-established. The APN Agent model uses existing regulatory frameworks (bank regulation, postal authority) rather than creating novel legal structures.

## Section 11: Measuring Success

### APNA Success Metrics

- Account uptake rate (target: 95%+ of eligible population within 5 years)
- Transaction costs (target: <0.05% of value)
- Service availability (target: 99.9% uptime)
- Banking desert coverage (target: 100% of underserved zip codes)

### APSA Success Metrics

- Enrollment rate (target: 95%+ of eligible adults within 2 years)
- Rapid deployment targets met (90/120/180 days/12 months)
- Adult poverty reduction (target: 50%+ reduction in deep poverty within 5 years)
- Economic security measures (emergency savings rates, financial stress indicators)
- Bridge Period Borrowing retirement (target: 6-8 years post-Bridge Period)

### SOCA Success Metrics

- Child enrollment rate (target: 98%+ of eligible children within 2 years)
- Child poverty reduction (target: 60%+ reduction in child poverty within 3 years)
- Deep child poverty reduction (target: 80%+ reduction within 3 years)
- Birth Support Payment uptake (target: 95%+ of eligible births within 2 years)
- Food insecurity reduction among families with children

### Integrated System Success

**Primary Measure:** Reduction in economic precarity across the lifecycle

The Compact succeeds when:

- Economic precarity declines measurably for both adults and children
- Household stability improves across income quartiles
- The infrastructure functions reliably and efficiently
- Political support remains durable across electoral cycles

---

## Section 12: Conclusion

The Compact is designed for political reality, not ideal conditions.

### Core Strategic Insights

1. **Modularity enables resilience.** Each act can pass independently, fail independently, or succeed together. No single legislative battle determines the outcome.

2. **Lifecycle coverage strengthens the case.** APNA provides infrastructure, APSA provides adult stability, SOCA provides child investment. Together they tell a complete story of shared prosperity.

3. **Rapid deployment transforms political calculus.** APSA delivers tangible benefits within months, not years. SOCA builds on established refundable credit infrastructure. Constituency building happens before the next election.

4. **Separate funding streams protect all programs.** APC funds APSA. Child Security Contribution funds SOCA. Neither competes with the other for resources.

5. **Multiple coalitions are stronger than one.** APNA attracts infrastructure advocates. APSA attracts labor and anti-poverty groups. SOCA attracts family-values voices. Combined, opposition is fragmented.

### The Framework Succeeds If:

- All three acts pass -- optimal outcome
- Any two acts pass -- substantial progress
- Any single act passes -- foundation for the others

That flexibility is the point.
