# FEDERAL JUDICIAL BALANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

## A Bill to Modernize the Federal Judiciary, Establish Population-Based Judicial Circuits, Expand the Supreme Court, and Ensure Balanced Representation

### Revision 1.2

---

## SECTION 1: SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act."

## SECTION 2: FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### (a) Findings

Congress finds that:

1. Article III of the Constitution vests judicial power in "one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish";

2. The Constitution provides that judges "shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour" and receive compensation that "shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office";

3. Congress has constitutional authority under Article III and the Necessary and Proper Clause to organize and structure the federal judiciary to ensure efficient administration of justice;

4. The current federal circuit system reflects historical boundaries rather than population distribution, creating unequal representation and workload disparities;

5. The Supreme Court has maintained nine justices since 1869, despite the creation of additional federal circuits and dramatic population growth;

6. The constitutional tradition of Supreme Court justices serving as circuit justices creates a direct representational relationship between regional circuits and the Supreme Court, with optimal judicial administration achieved when each regional circuit is served by one Supreme Court justice;

7. Regular and predictable judicial appointments promote constitutional balance and reduce partisan manipulation of the appointment process;

8. Clear definition of judicial duties and responsibilities promotes effective court administration and public confidence in the judiciary;

9. Transparent qualification standards enhance the legitimacy and quality of judicial appointments;

10. The current system creates arbitrary advantages for presidents based on actuarial chance rather than constitutional design;

11. The position of Chief Justice should rotate among justices as a capstone to distinguished service rather than concentrating administrative power in a single individual for decades.

### (b) Purposes

The purposes of this Act are to:

1. Establish population-based federal judicial circuits to ensure equal representation;

2. Align Supreme Court composition with regional circuit organization to restore constitutional balance between Court size and judicial administration;

3. Create predictable and fair judicial appointment processes;

4. Define the duties and responsibilities of federal judicial offices;

5. Establish minimum qualifications for judicial service;

6. Enhance transparency in the judicial appointment process;

7. Ensure optimal utilization of judicial experience and expertise;

8. Restore constitutional balance among the branches of government;

9. Diffuse the concentration of power in the Chief Justice position through automatic rotation.

## SECTION 3: DEFINITIONS

In this Act:

1. **"Active service"** means the performance of regular duties as a member of the court to which appointed;

2. **"Senior service"** means judicial service in a capacity other than active service on the court of original appointment;

3. **"Supreme Court justice"** means a person holding the office of Chief Justice or Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States;

4. **"Federal judge"** means any judge appointed under Article III of the Constitution;

5. **"Population-based circuit"** means a judicial circuit organized primarily according to population distribution rather than state boundaries;

6. **"Regional circuit"** means one of the fifteen numbered judicial circuits serving approximately equal populations across the United States.
