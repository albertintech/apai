## Problem Statement

The federal judiciary operates under a structure designed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that no longer serves constitutional principles of equal representation and balanced power. Three interconnected dysfunctions undermine public confidence and judicial effectiveness.

**Population imbalance across circuits.** The current thirteen federal circuits reflect historical state groupings rather than contemporary population distribution. The Ninth Circuit serves over 68 million people across nine states and two territories; the First Circuit serves under 14 million across six states and territories. This nearly five-to-one disparity creates unequal workloads, inconsistent case processing times, and fundamentally unequal access to federal justice depending on where litigants happen to reside. As population continues shifting toward the Sun Belt and away from the Northeast, these disparities will only worsen.

**Arbitrary appointment opportunities.** Supreme Court vacancies depend entirely on when sitting justices die or choose to retire -- factors bearing no relationship to constitutional design or democratic mandate. President Carter appointed zero justices during his term; President Trump appointed three in four years. This actuarial randomness means that some presidents shape constitutional interpretation for generations while others leave no mark on the Court at all. The resulting incentives encourage strategic retirement timing, discourage justices from stepping down during administrations of the opposing party, and concentrate enormous power based on luck rather than legitimate democratic processes.

**Erosion of confirmation norms.** The judicial appointment process has devolved from professional evaluation to partisan warfare. The Senate blocked consideration of the Garland nomination for nearly a year in 2016, then confirmed the Barrett nomination in weeks during 2020. Qualification standards have weakened as ideological alignment increasingly trumps professional credentials. The confirmation process provides no structural guarantee that the Senate will act on nominations, that nominees will meet minimum professional standards, or that the public will receive meaningful information about judicial philosophy before lifetime appointments are made.

These are not partisan complaints about specific outcomes. They are structural failures that would concern any observer regardless of which party benefits at any given moment. The current system depends on norms of restraint and good faith that have collapsed under partisan pressure. Structural reform is necessary because informal constraints have proven inadequate.

## Solution Architecture

FJBAA addresses these dysfunctions through five integrated structural mechanisms rather than relying on norms, restraint, or good intentions.

**Population-based circuit organization** replaces historical boundaries with mathematical formula. Fifteen regional circuits serve approximately equal populations, with boundaries rebalanced following each decennial census. This ensures equal representation and balanced workloads regardless of where populations migrate over time. The structure eliminates the current disparities automatically -- no future legislation required as demographics shift.

**Circuit-aligned Court composition** ties Supreme Court size to administrative structure rather than political convenience. Fifteen Associate Justices correspond to fifteen regional circuits, restoring the historical relationship between circuit organization and Court membership that existed when six justices served six circuits and nine justices served nine circuits. This provides a principled basis for Court size that transcends immediate partisan calculations and forecloses endless expansion.

**Predictable appointment schedule** removes actuarial randomness from presidential opportunities. After a phased transition period, one justice transitions to senior service each odd-numbered year, guaranteeing exactly two appointment opportunities per presidential term regardless of party. This regularization means every president shapes the Court proportionally to their democratic mandate, and no president gains windfall advantages from fortunate timing.

**Automatic Chief Justice rotation** diffuses the concentration of power that currently resides in the Chief Justice position. Rather than a single individual serving as Chief Justice for decades based on presidential selection and actuarial chance, the position rotates automatically among justices based on seniority. Each justice serves as Chief Justice for their final two years of active service before transitioning to senior status. Every justice who completes a full term serves as Chief Justice -- democratizing an honor and responsibility that the current system distributes arbitrarily.

**Structural qualification and transparency requirements** replace informal expectations with enforceable standards. Minimum professional qualifications ensure nominees have substantial judicial records. Mandatory documentation requirements shift confirmation from theatrical questioning to substantive credential evaluation. Timeline requirements guarantee Senate action rather than indefinite obstruction.

These mechanisms work together as a coherent system. Circuit reorganization provides the principled basis for Court expansion. Court expansion enables the regular appointment schedule. The appointment schedule creates the predictable tenure that makes automatic Chief Justice rotation possible. Qualification requirements ensure the expanded appointment process produces competent judges. Each component reinforces the others.

## Title-by-Title Summary

**Title I: Federal Circuit Reorganization** establishes fifteen population-based regional circuits replacing the current geographic arrangement. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts draws boundaries within 180 days of enactment, ensuring no circuit serves more than 110% or less than 90% of the average circuit population. Boundaries rebalance automatically following each decennial census. Existing circuit judges are reassigned based on primary residence. The District of Columbia Circuit and Federal Circuit retain their specialized jurisdictions unchanged, preserving established expertise in administrative law and patent matters. Each regional circuit maintains at least six active judges.

**Title II: Supreme Court Composition and Appointments** expands the Court to fifteen Associate Justices and one Chief Justice. Expansion proceeds gradually -- one additional justice appointed each odd-numbered year during the transition period. After twelve years of active service, justices transition to senior service rather than serving until death or voluntary retirement. Senior justices retain full Article III status and constitutional protections, may continue hearing cases by assignment, and receive full compensation -- but their transition creates a predictable vacancy. The Chief Justice position rotates automatically by seniority: the most senior Associate Justice who has not previously served as Chief Justice assumes the role upon commencing their eleventh year of active service, serving as Chief Justice for two years before transitioning to senior service. No separate nomination or confirmation is required. Once fully implemented, every presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities.

**Title III: Qualifications and Transparency** establishes minimum requirements for Supreme Court service: citizenship for at least ten years, an accredited law degree, good standing bar admission, at least fifteen years of legal experience, and at least five years as a federal appellate judge. The federal appellate requirement ensures every nominee has an extensive written record of judicial opinions for evaluation. Nominees must provide comprehensive documentation -- professional biography, personal background statement, and judicial philosophy statement -- all publicly disclosed at least thirty days before confirmation hearings. A five-member judicial qualifications panel reviews each nominee. The Senate must complete consideration within 120 days.

**Title IV: Implementation and Fairness Provisions** phases the reforms across multiple years. Circuit reorganization takes effect on the first January 1 at least twenty-four months after enactment, allowing adequate preparation time. Court expansion begins in the first odd-numbered year at least eighteen months after enactment. The regular replacement schedule begins twelve years after the first expansion appointment. Automatic Chief Justice rotation begins when the first justice appointed under the expansion schedule reaches their eleventh year of active service. Constitutional protections are explicitly preserved: no sitting justice is removed from office, no judicial salary is reduced, and "good behavior" tenure remains fully intact. Justices serving on the effective date may continue in active service or voluntarily elect senior status. Severability provisions ensure partial implementation if any provision faces successful legal challenge.

## Implementation Overview

FJBAA unfolds across three phases spanning approximately fifteen years from enactment to steady-state operation.

**Phase One (Years 1-2): Circuit Reorganization.** The Administrative Office develops population-based circuit boundaries. States and courts prepare for transition. New circuit structure takes effect approximately two years after enactment. Existing judges are reassigned; additional circuit judges are appointed as needed.

**Phase Two (Years 2-12): Court Expansion.** Beginning in the first odd-numbered year at least eighteen months after enactment, the President nominates one additional Supreme Court justice. This continues each odd-numbered year until the Court reaches fifteen Associate Justices -- approximately six expansion appointments total. During this transition, multiple administrations participate in shaping the expanded Court.

**Phase Three (Year 13+): Regular Replacement and Chief Justice Rotation.** Twelve years after the first expansion appointment, the most senior justice appointed under the expansion schedule transitions to senior service. This begins the regular replacement cycle: one transition per odd-numbered year, two appointments per presidential term, indefinitely. Automatic Chief Justice rotation also begins during this phase, when the first expansion-appointed justice reaches their eleventh year of active service. From that point forward, each justice serves as Chief Justice for their final two years before transitioning to senior service. The system reaches equilibrium and operates predictably thereafter.

This phased approach serves multiple purposes. It spreads expansion appointments across multiple administrations, preventing any single president from dominating the transition. It allows the judicial system time to absorb changes incrementally. It demonstrates the reform's operation before reaching full implementation, building legitimacy through successful execution.

## Conclusion

FJBAA represents structural judicial reform rather than ideological court-packing. The distinction matters. Court-packing -- adding seats to change immediate outcomes -- triggers an arms race with no stopping principle and destroys institutional legitimacy. FJBAA ties Court size to circuit organization, phases expansion across multiple administrations, creates a regular replacement schedule that treats all future presidents equally regardless of party, and diffuses the power of the Chief Justice position through automatic rotation.

The reform addresses genuine structural problems: population imbalance across circuits, arbitrary appointment opportunities based on actuarial chance, concentration of power in a single Chief Justice for decades, and the collapse of confirmation norms. It does so through mechanisms that work regardless of which party holds power at any given moment.

FJBAA does not predetermine judicial outcomes, mandate particular judicial philosophies, or remove any sitting justice. It creates conditions for a well-functioning judiciary -- equal representation, predictable appointments, diffused leadership, qualified judges, transparent processes -- without dictating what that judiciary should decide.
