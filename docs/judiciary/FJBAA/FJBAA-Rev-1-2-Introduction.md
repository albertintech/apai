# Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

## Policy Introduction

### Published January 2025

Based on Rev 1.2 of the Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

---

The Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA) restructures the federal judiciary to address population-based representation, predictable appointments, and qualification standards. The Act reorganizes federal circuits according to population, aligns Supreme Court composition with circuit structure, and establishes transparent processes for judicial appointments.

The current federal circuit system reflects nineteenth-century boundaries rather than contemporary population distribution, creating significant workload disparities and unequal representation across regions. The Supreme Court has maintained nine justices since 1869 despite dramatic population growth and the addition of new circuits. Meanwhile, judicial appointments depend heavily on actuarial chance -- which justices happen to retire or die during which presidential terms -- rather than any principled constitutional design.

FJBAA addresses these structural problems through four integrated reforms: circuit reorganization, Supreme Court expansion aligned with circuit structure, a predictable appointment schedule, and enhanced qualification and transparency requirements.

## Key Components

**Title I: Federal Circuit Reorganization** establishes fifteen population-based regional circuits, each serving approximately equal populations as determined by the decennial census. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts draws boundaries ensuring no circuit serves more than 110% or less than 90% of the average circuit population. Boundaries rebalance following each census. The District of Columbia Circuit and Federal Circuit retain their specialized jurisdictions unchanged.

**Title II: Supreme Court Composition and Appointments** expands the Supreme Court to fifteen Associate Justices and one Chief Justice, restoring the historical relationship between circuit organization and Court size. Expansion proceeds gradually -- one additional justice appointed each odd-numbered year until the Court reaches full composition. After twelve years of active service, justices transition to senior service, where they retain full Article III protections and may continue hearing cases by assignment. The Chief Justice position rotates automatically: the most senior Associate Justice who has not previously served as Chief Justice assumes the role upon their eleventh year of active service, serving as Chief Justice for their final two years before transitioning to senior service. This ensures every justice who completes a full term serves as Chief Justice, diffusing power that would otherwise concentrate in a single individual for decades. Once fully implemented, each presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities, removing the arbitrary advantages that actuarial chance currently provides.

**Title III: Qualifications and Transparency** establishes minimum professional requirements for Supreme Court service: at least fifteen years of legal experience and five years as a federal appellate judge. Nominees must provide comprehensive documentation including professional biography, personal background statement, and judicial philosophy statement -- all publicly disclosed at least thirty days before confirmation hearings. A judicial qualifications panel reviews each nominee, and the Senate must complete consideration within 120 days.

**Title IV: Implementation and Fairness Provisions** phases the reforms over multiple years. Circuit reorganization takes effect approximately two years after enactment. Court expansion begins in the first odd-numbered year at least eighteen months after enactment and continues until full composition is achieved. The regular replacement schedule begins twelve years after the first expansion appointment; automatic Chief Justice rotation begins when the first justice appointed under the expansion schedule reaches their eleventh year of active service. Constitutional protections are explicitly preserved: no sitting justice is removed, no judicial salary is reduced, and "good behavior" tenure remains intact. The senior service provisions build on existing precedent in 28 U.S.C. Section 371.
