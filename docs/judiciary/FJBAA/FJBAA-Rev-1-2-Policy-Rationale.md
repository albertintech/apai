## Design Philosophy

FJBAA applies the core APAI principle that structures are superior to norms. The current judicial system depends heavily on informal constraints: the expectation that presidents nominate qualified candidates, that the Senate considers nominations in good faith, that justices exercise restraint, that Court size remains stable absent genuine administrative need, and that the Chief Justice will exercise accumulated power responsibly. These norms have eroded significantly under partisan pressure.

Recent decades demonstrate the pattern. Senate blockade of the Garland nomination in 2016 broke the norm of timely consideration. The Barrett confirmation in 2020 broke the opposing norm against election-year appointments. Qualification standards have become increasingly contested. The confirmation process has devolved into partisan theater. These failures are not aberrations -- they are the predictable result of relying on informal constraints that any sufficiently motivated actor can abandon.

FJBAA replaces norm-dependent processes with structural mechanisms. Population-based circuits guarantee fair representation through mathematical formula rather than informal boundary-setting. Circuit-aligned Court composition provides a principled basis for Court size tied to administrative structure rather than political convenience. Predictable appointment schedules remove actuarial randomness from presidential opportunities. Automatic Chief Justice rotation diffuses concentrated power through seniority-based succession rather than presidential selection. Defined qualifications establish minimum competence regardless of political pressure.

The design philosophy also distinguishes FJBAA from crude "court packing" proposals. Traditional court packing -- adding seats to change outcomes -- triggers an arms race with no stopping principle. Each party adds seats when in power; the Court expands indefinitely; legitimacy collapses. FJBAA instead ties Court size to circuit organization, providing a principled basis that transcends immediate partisan advantage. The phased expansion and regular replacement schedule ensures no single president receives disproportionate appointments.

## Problem Analysis

The federal judiciary suffers from four structural dysfunctions that FJBAA addresses.

**Circuit imbalance.** The current thirteen circuits reflect nineteenth-century boundaries rather than contemporary population distribution. The Ninth Circuit serves over 68 million people; the First Circuit serves under 14 million. This creates massive workload disparities, inconsistent case processing times, and unequal access to justice depending on where litigants reside. The problem compounds over time as population shifts accelerate.

**Actuarial randomness in appointments.** Supreme Court vacancies depend on when justices die or retire -- factors unrelated to constitutional design. Some presidents appoint four justices; others appoint none. This arbitrary distribution concentrates judicial power based on luck rather than democratic mandate. Presidents who happen to serve during natural vacancies shape constitutional interpretation for decades; presidents who don't are denied meaningful influence over the Court's direction.

**Concentration of power in the Chief Justice.** The current system allows a single individual to serve as Chief Justice for decades, accumulating enormous administrative and symbolic power. Chief Justice John Marshall served 34 years; Chief Justice Roger Taney served 28 years; Chief Justice John Roberts has served nearly 20 years and counting. This concentration depends entirely on which president happens to face a Chief Justice vacancy and how long that appointee lives. The Chief Justice chairs the Judicial Conference, appoints judges to the FISA Court and other specialized tribunals, assigns opinions when in the majority, presides over impeachment trials, and serves as the public face of the federal judiciary. These powers -- accumulated through statutory accretion rather than constitutional design -- concentrate in one person based on actuarial chance rather than any democratic principle.

**Norm erosion in confirmations.** The confirmation process has become a partisan battlefield. Qualified nominees face obstruction based on timing rather than credentials. Unqualified nominees advance based on ideological alignment rather than competence. The process provides no structural guarantee that the Senate will act, that nominees will meet minimum standards, or that the public will receive meaningful information about judicial philosophy.

## Alternatives Considered

Several alternative approaches to judicial reform exist. FJBAA's design reflects considered judgment about their relative merits and limitations.

**Eighteen-year term limits** would create regular appointment opportunities without expanding the Court. This approach has significant support among legal scholars. However, term limits likely require constitutional amendment -- the "good behavior" clause in Article III has historically been interpreted as life tenure. FJBAA achieves similar regularity through senior service transition, which preserves Article III status and builds on existing precedent in 28 U.S.C. Section 371 for senior judges.

**Simple court expansion** (adding seats without structural justification) addresses immediate imbalance but provides no stopping principle. If Democrats add four seats, Republicans add six when they regain power. The Court expands indefinitely, losing institutional legitimacy. FJBAA's circuit-aligned expansion provides a principled ceiling: one Associate Justice per regional circuit, plus the Chief Justice.

**Jurisdiction stripping** would limit the Court's authority over specific issues. This approach raises serious constitutional concerns and does nothing to address circuit imbalance or appointment randomness. It treats symptoms rather than structural causes.

**Rotation schemes** would cycle justices between the Supreme Court and lower courts. These proposals face substantial constitutional objections -- Article III arguably requires stable court assignments -- and create administrative complexity without addressing the underlying problems of circuit organization or appointment unpredictability.

**Traditional Chief Justice appointment** maintains the current practice of presidential nomination and Senate confirmation for the Chief Justice position. This approach has the weight of historical practice behind it. However, it perpetuates the concentration of power problem: a single president selects who will lead the judiciary for potentially decades, and that selection depends on the accident of when a Chief Justice vacancy occurs. It also creates perverse incentives -- presidents may prioritize youth over experience to maximize their appointee's tenure, and sitting Chief Justices may time retirement strategically based on partisan calculations. FJBAA's automatic rotation eliminates these dynamics while ensuring every justice who completes a full term shares in the honor and responsibility of leading the Court.

FJBAA combines the benefits of regular appointments (from term limit proposals) with principled Court sizing (avoiding court-packing dynamics) and diffused leadership (through automatic rotation) while remaining within Congress's established constitutional authority to organize the judiciary.

## Provision Rationale

**Title I: Circuit Reorganization.** Population-based circuits ensure equal representation and balanced workloads. The 90-110% population band provides flexibility for geographic contiguity while preventing extreme disparities. Decennial rebalancing maintains equality as populations shift. Preserving the D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit's specialized jurisdictions avoids disrupting established administrative and patent law expertise.

**Title II: Court Composition and Appointments.** Fifteen Associate Justices align with fifteen regional circuits, restoring the historical relationship between circuit organization and Court size. (The original six-justice Court corresponded to six circuits; the nine-justice Court corresponded to nine circuits.) Phased expansion -- one justice per odd-numbered year -- prevents any single president from dominating appointments during the transition. The twelve-year active service period balances meaningful tenure with regular turnover. Senior service preserves Article III protections while creating predictable vacancies.

The automatic Chief Justice rotation serves multiple purposes. First, it diffuses power that would otherwise concentrate in a single individual for decades. The Chief Justice's administrative authority -- chairing the Judicial Conference, appointing judges to specialized courts, managing the federal judiciary's budget requests -- affects the entire third branch. Rotating this authority ensures no single justice accumulates outsized influence over judicial administration. Second, it democratizes the position among the justices themselves. Under the current system, only those who happen to be selected by a president facing a Chief Justice vacancy ever serve in the role. Under FJBAA, every justice who completes a full term serves as Chief Justice -- making it a capstone to distinguished service rather than a lottery prize. Third, it removes a source of partisan manipulation. Presidents currently have incentive to nominate young Chief Justices to maximize tenure; FJBAA eliminates this calculation. Fourth, it aligns with the principle that all justices are equals. The Constitution mentions the Chief Justice only once (presiding over presidential impeachment trials) and does not clearly establish the position as a separate office. The automatic rotation treats the Chief Justice designation as what it constitutionally is: a duty assignment among equal Article III judges.

The two-year Chief Justice term (years eleven and twelve of active service) provides sufficient time for administrative leadership while ensuring regular rotation. It also creates a natural capstone: each justice's final years of active service are spent leading the Court, followed by transition to senior service. The seniority-based selection -- most senior Associate Justice who has not previously served -- ensures orderly succession and prevents any justice from being passed over.

**Title III: Qualifications and Transparency.** Minimum qualifications -- fifteen years legal experience, five years as federal appellate judge -- ensure nominees have substantial judicial records to evaluate. The federal appellate requirement means every nominee has authored opinions that reveal judicial philosophy, reducing confirmation theater around hypothetical questions. Mandatory documentation and public disclosure shift the confirmation process toward substantive evaluation of credentials and judicial approach.

**Title IV: Implementation.** Phased implementation over multiple years allows orderly transition. Circuit reorganization precedes Court expansion, ensuring the structural justification exists before new seats are filled. Automatic Chief Justice rotation begins when the first justice appointed under the expansion schedule reaches their eleventh year of active service, ensuring the mechanism operates only for justices appointed with knowledge of the rotation system. The fairness provisions explicitly preserve constitutional protections -- no sitting justice is removed, no salary is reduced, life tenure continues. The severability clause ensures partial implementation if any provision faces legal challenge.

## Addressing Concerns

**Constitutionality.** Congress has clear constitutional authority to organize the federal judiciary. Article III vests judicial power in "one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish." Congress has changed the number of Supreme Court justices seven times. Congress has reorganized circuit boundaries repeatedly. The senior service provisions build directly on existing statutory precedent for senior judges. Nothing in FJBAA removes any judge from office or reduces any salary -- the two actions Article III explicitly prohibits.

**Partisan manipulation.** Critics may argue FJBAA advantages whichever party passes it. Three design features address this concern. First, phased expansion spreads appointments across multiple administrations -- no single president gains more than two or three seats during transition. Second, the regular replacement schedule guarantees exactly two appointments per presidential term once fully implemented, regardless of party. Third, circuit-aligned sizing provides a principled ceiling that constrains future manipulation.

**Complexity and disruption.** Judicial reorganization is administratively complex. FJBAA addresses this through phased implementation, allowing the Administrative Office two years to develop circuit boundaries and states time to adjust. Existing judges are reassigned based on residence, minimizing disruption. District court structure remains unchanged. The transition is significant but manageable -- comparable to past circuit reorganizations that the federal judiciary has successfully navigated.

**Qualification requirements.** Some may object that the Constitution sets no qualifications for federal judges, and Congress should not add them. However, FJBAA's qualifications are statutory requirements for nomination, not constitutional amendments. Congress routinely attaches conditions to presidential appointments through advice-and-consent processes. The requirements ensure minimum competence without constraining presidential discretion beyond that floor.

**Chief Justice rotation and the Appointments Clause.** Critics may argue that automatic Chief Justice rotation violates the Appointments Clause by bypassing presidential nomination and Senate confirmation. This objection misunderstands the constitutional structure. The justice becoming Chief Justice has already been nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and appointed as an Article III judge -- the Appointments Clause has been fully satisfied. What FJBAA does is reassign duties within an existing appointment. The Constitution does not clearly establish the Chief Justice as a separate office requiring independent appointment; it mentions the position only once (presiding over presidential impeachment trials) and refers elsewhere simply to "Judges of the supreme Court." Congress has broad authority to regulate judicial duties, and rotating the Chief Justice designation among already-appointed justices falls within that authority. The parallel to circuit court chief judges -- who assume that position by seniority under 28 U.S.C. Section 45 without new appointment -- supports this analysis.

**Administrative continuity.** Some may worry that two-year Chief Justice terms create instability in judicial administration. This concern is overstated. The Chief Justice's administrative functions are supported by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, which provides institutional continuity regardless of who holds the Chief Justice position. Two years provides adequate time for any administrative initiatives while ensuring rotation. Many institutional leadership positions -- committee chairs, board presidents, organizational officers -- operate effectively with similar or shorter terms. The federal judiciary's administrative apparatus does not depend on decades-long Chief Justice tenure.

**Diminished prestige.** Critics might argue that automatic rotation diminishes the Chief Justice position. The opposite is true. Under the current system, the Chief Justice position is a prize awarded to one justice based on presidential preference and actuarial luck -- most justices never have the opportunity to serve regardless of their qualifications or contributions. Under FJBAA, every justice who completes a full term serves as Chief Justice, making it a universal honor recognizing distinguished service rather than a selective appointment. The position retains all its constitutional and statutory functions; only the selection mechanism changes.

## What FJBAA Does Not Do

FJBAA does not impose term limits that would require constitutional amendment. It does not remove any sitting justice. It does not strip jurisdiction or limit the Court's constitutional role. It does not mandate specific judicial philosophies or decision-making approaches. It does not address lower court expansion beyond ensuring adequate circuit resources.

The reform is deliberately focused on structural problems -- circuit imbalance, appointment randomness, concentration of power in the Chief Justice, qualification gaps, and transparency deficits -- rather than attempting to dictate substantive outcomes. FJBAA creates conditions for a well-functioning judiciary without predetermining what that judiciary should decide.
