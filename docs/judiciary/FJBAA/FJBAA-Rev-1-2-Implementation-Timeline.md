# Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

## Implementation Timeline

### Published January 2025

Based on Rev 1.2 of the Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

---

## Timeline Overview

FJBAA unfolds across three phases spanning approximately fifteen years from enactment to steady-state operation. The phased approach serves critical purposes: it spreads appointment opportunities across multiple administrations, allows the judicial system to absorb changes incrementally, and demonstrates successful operation before reaching full implementation.

All dates below assume enactment with an effective date of January 1, 2026, as specified in Section 403(a). If enacted later, all subsequent dates shift accordingly.

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Phase One: Circuit Reorganization | Years 1-2 | New circuit structure operational January 1, 2028 |
| Phase Two: Court Expansion | Years 2-12 | Full 16-member Court achieved by 2037 |
| Phase Three: Regular Replacement and Chief Justice Rotation | Year 11+ | Automatic CJ rotation begins 2037; regular replacement begins 2039 |

## Effective Date Architecture

### Immediate Upon Enactment (January 1, 2026)

**Qualification requirements take effect.** All provisions of Title III apply immediately to any Supreme Court justice nominated after the effective date. This includes:

- Minimum professional requirements (15 years legal experience, 5 years federal appellate service)
- Mandatory documentation (professional biography, personal background statement, judicial philosophy statement)
- Public disclosure requirements (30 days before confirmation hearings)
- Judicial qualifications panel review
- 120-day Senate consideration timeline

**Existing justices protected.** Justices serving on January 1, 2026 may continue in active service indefinitely or voluntarily elect senior service at any time. No sitting justice is removed; no salary is reduced.

**Administrative Office begins boundary development.** The 180-day clock for circuit boundary proposals begins.

### Within 180 Days (By June 30, 2026)

**Circuit boundary development complete.** The Administrative Office of the United States Courts must:

- Divide national population into fifteen approximately equal segments
- Assign each segment to a numbered regional circuit
- Ensure no circuit serves more than 110% or less than 90% of average population
- Prioritize geographic contiguity where feasible
- Submit proposed boundaries for Congressional review

### First January 1 at Least 24 Months After Enactment (January 1, 2028)

**New circuit structure takes effect.** The fifteen regional circuits become operational. This date allows:

- 18+ months for courts, states, and practitioners to prepare
- Time for additional circuit judge appointments
- Orderly reassignment of existing judges by primary residence
- Adjustment of case routing and administrative systems

### First Odd-Numbered Year at Least 18 Months After Enactment (2027)

**Court expansion begins.** The President nominates the first additional Associate Justice. This timing ensures:

- Expansion begins after circuit reorganization is underway
- At least one full year of preparation before first expansion appointment
- Appointments occur on predictable biennial schedule thereafter

### Eleven Years After First Expansion Appointment (2037)

**Automatic Chief Justice rotation begins.** The first justice appointed under the expansion schedule (appointed 2027) commences their eleventh year of active service and automatically becomes Chief Justice. This marks the beginning of the automatic rotation system:

- No separate nomination or confirmation required
- The justice serves as Chief Justice for years eleven and twelve of active service
- Upon completing year twelve, the justice transitions to senior service
- The next most senior Associate Justice who has not served as Chief Justice assumes the role

### Twelve Years After First Expansion Appointment (2039)

**Regular replacement schedule begins.** The most senior justice appointed under the expansion schedule transitions to senior service, creating the first regular replacement vacancy. From this point forward:

- One justice transitions to senior service each odd-numbered year
- Each four-year presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities
- The system operates predictably indefinitely

---

## Phase One: Circuit Reorganization (2026-2028)

### Year One (2026)

**Q1 2026: Effective Date and Initiation**
- FJBAA takes effect January 1, 2026
- Qualification requirements apply to all future Supreme Court nominations

- Appeals proceed to appropriate regional circuits
- D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit continue unchanged

---

## Phase Two: Court Expansion (2027-2037)

Court expansion proceeds gradually with one additional Associate Justice appointed each odd-numbered year. This distributes appointments across multiple administrations and prevents any single president from dominating the expanded Court.

### Expansion Schedule

| Year | Appointment | Court Composition | Presidential Term |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2027 | 1st expansion | 10 members | Term ending Jan 2029 |
| 2029 | 2nd expansion | 11 members | Term ending Jan 2033 |
| 2031 | 3rd expansion | 12 members | Term ending Jan 2033 |
| 2033 | 4th expansion | 13 members | Term ending Jan 2037 |
| 2035 | 5th expansion | 14 members | Term ending Jan 2037 |
| 2037 | 6th expansion | 15 Associate Justices + Chief Justice = 16 members | Term ending Jan 2041 |

### Expansion Phase Characteristics

**Distributed appointment opportunities.** Assuming standard presidential terms, expansion appointments are distributed across at least three different administrations. No single president receives more than two expansion appointments unless they serve multiple terms.

**Qualification requirements apply throughout.** Every expansion nominee must meet Title III requirements: 15 years legal experience, 5 years federal appellate service, mandatory documentation, panel review, and 120-day Senate consideration timeline.

**Existing justices unaffected.** Justices serving before FJBAA's effective date continue in active service. They are not subject to the senior service transition schedule or automatic Chief Justice rotation. The existing Chief Justice continues in that capacity until death, voluntary election of senior service, or removal.

**Chief Justice transition period.** Until automatic rotation begins in 2037, the Chief Justice serving on the effective date continues in that capacity. If a vacancy in the Chief Justice position occurs before automatic rotation begins, the President designates a Chief Justice from among sitting Associate Justices, subject to Senate confirmation, to serve until automatic rotation begins.

---

## Phase Three: Regular Replacement and Chief Justice Rotation (2037+)

Beginning eleven years after the first expansion appointment, automatic Chief Justice rotation begins. Beginning twelve years after the first expansion appointment, FJBAA transitions to steady-state operation with predictable biennial appointments and regular Chief Justice succession.

### Chief Justice Rotation and Replacement Schedule

| Year | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2037 | 1st automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2027 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2038 | CJ continues | Justice appointed 2027 serves year 12 as Chief Justice |
| 2039 | 1st replacement; 2nd automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2027 transitions to senior service; Justice appointed 2029 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2040 | CJ continues | Justice appointed 2029 serves year 12 as Chief Justice |
| 2041 | 2nd replacement; 3rd automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2029 transitions to senior service; Justice appointed 2031 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2042 | CJ continues | Justice appointed 2031 serves year 12 as Chief Justice |
| 2043 | 3rd replacement; 4th automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2031 transitions to senior service; Justice appointed 2033 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2045 | 4th replacement; 5th automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2033 transitions to senior service; Justice appointed 2035 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2047 | 5th replacement; 6th automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2035 transitions to senior service; Justice appointed 2037 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2049 | 6th replacement | Justice appointed 2037 transitions to senior service |
| 2051+ | Continuing cycle | Pattern continues indefinitely |

### Steady-State Characteristics

**Predictable presidential opportunities.** Every four-year presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities (two odd-numbered years). This equalizes influence across administrations regardless of party.

**Twelve-year active service terms.** Each justice serves twelve years in active status before transitioning to senior service. This provides meaningful tenure while ensuring regular turnover.

**Two-year Chief Justice terms.** Each justice serves as Chief Justice for their final two years of active service (years eleven and twelve). This provides sufficient time for administrative leadership while ensuring regular rotation and diffusing power that would otherwise concentrate in a single individual.

**Every justice serves as Chief Justice.** Under the automatic rotation system, every justice who completes a full twelve-year term serves as Chief Justice. The position becomes a capstone to distinguished service rather than a selective appointment based on presidential preference and actuarial chance.

**Seniority-based succession.** The most senior Associate Justice who has not previously served as Chief Justice automatically assumes the role upon commencing their eleventh year. This ensures orderly succession and prevents any justice from being passed over.

**Senior service preserves Article III status.** Transitioning justices retain full constitutional protections, salary, benefits, and life tenure. They may continue hearing cases by Chief Justice assignment, sit on circuit courts by designation, or decline assignments without penalty.

**Voluntary early transition permitted.** Any justice may elect senior service before completing twelve years, creating an immediate vacancy. This provides flexibility while maintaining the regular schedule as the default. A justice who elects early senior service before serving as Chief Justice forgoes that opportunity.

## Sequencing Requirements

Certain provisions must occur in sequence; others may proceed in parallel.

### Sequential Dependencies

1. **Boundary development must precede circuit reorganization.** The Administrative Office must complete population-based boundary proposals before new circuits can take effect.

2. **Circuit reorganization provides basis for Court expansion.** The principled justification for fifteen Associate Justices -- one per regional circuit -- requires the circuit structure to be established or underway before expansion begins.

3. **Expansion must precede regular replacement.** The twelve-year clock for senior service transition begins only for justices appointed under the expansion schedule. Regular replacement cannot begin until at least twelve years after the first expansion appointment.

4. **Expansion must precede automatic Chief Justice rotation.** The eleven-year clock for Chief Justice rotation begins only for justices appointed under the expansion schedule. Automatic rotation cannot begin until at least eleven years after the first expansion appointment.

5. **Chief Justice rotation precedes regular replacement for each justice.** Each justice becomes Chief Justice upon commencing year eleven, then transitions to senior service upon completing year twelve. The Chief Justice term immediately precedes the senior service transition.

### Parallel Tracks

- **Qualification requirements and circuit reorganization** proceed independently. Title III applies immediately while Title I phases in over two years.

- **Circuit judge appointments and Supreme Court expansion** may proceed in parallel. Additional circuit judges for the reorganized circuits do not depend on Supreme Court composition.

- **Existing justice decisions** are independent. Sitting justices may voluntarily elect senior service at any time without affecting the expansion or replacement schedule.

---

## Institutional Requirements

### Administrative Office Responsibilities

- Develop population-based circuit boundaries within 180 days
- Propose decennial boundary adjustments following each census
- Coordinate judicial reassignments based on primary residence
- Assess circuit judge staffing needs

### Judicial Qualifications Panel

Section 303(b) establishes a five-member panel for each Supreme Court nominee:
- Two federal judges selected by the Chief Justice
- Two practicing attorneys selected by the American Bar Association
- One law professor selected by the Association of American Law Schools

This panel must be constituted for each nomination and complete its review before Senate confirmation.

### Senate Judiciary Committee

- Conduct public hearings within 60 days of receiving nomination
- Complete floor vote within 120 days of receiving nomination
- Process increased nomination volume during expansion phase

### Appropriations Requirements

Section 404 authorizes appropriations for:
- Additional judicial salaries and benefits (circuit judges, expanded Supreme Court)
- Court facilities and administrative costs
- Circuit reorganization implementation
- Enhanced qualification review processes

---

## Transition Provisions

### Existing Supreme Court Justices

Justices serving on January 1, 2026:
- May continue in active service indefinitely
- May voluntarily elect senior service at any time
- Are not subject to mandatory senior service transition
- Are not subject to automatic Chief Justice rotation
- Retain all constitutional protections and benefits

### Existing Chief Justice

The Chief Justice serving on the effective date:
- Continues in that capacity until death, voluntary election of senior service, or removal
- Is not subject to the two-year term limit applicable to justices appointed under this Act
- If a vacancy occurs before automatic rotation begins (2037), the President designates a replacement from among sitting Associate Justices, subject to Senate confirmation

### Chief Justice Incapacity or Vacancy (After Automatic Rotation Begins)

Once automatic rotation is operational:
- If the Chief Justice is temporarily unable to perform duties, the Associate Justice with the longest tenure in active service serves as Acting Chief Justice
- If the Chief Justice dies, is removed, or elects early senior service during their term, the Associate Justice next in line under the automatic selection process becomes Chief Justice for the remainder of their own eleventh and twelfth years of active service
- If no Associate Justice has reached their eleventh year of active service when a vacancy occurs, the transition period provisions apply

### Existing Circuit Judges

Circuit judges serving when reorganization takes effect:
- Are reassigned to the regional circuit encompassing their primary residence
- Maintain their Article III status and tenure
- Continue hearing cases in their reassigned circuit
- May request senior status under existing 28 U.S.C. Section 371 provisions

### Pending Cases

- Cases pending in circuit courts continue in the newly designated circuit
- No disruption to ongoing proceedings
- Appeals filed after January 1, 2028 proceed to the appropriate regional circuit

---

## Flexibility and Firm Dates

### Firm Requirements

- **180-day boundary development deadline:** Statutory requirement, not discretionary
- **24-month minimum before circuit reorganization:** Ensures adequate preparation
- **18-month minimum before first expansion appointment:** Ensures orderly sequencing
- **11-year active service before Chief Justice rotation:** Defines when automatic CJ selection occurs
- **12-year active service before senior transition:** Defines replacement schedule
- **2-year Chief Justice term:** Years eleven and twelve of active service
- **Odd-numbered year appointments:** Creates predictable biennial schedule
- **120-day Senate consideration:** Prevents indefinite obstruction

### Flexible Elements

- **Specific circuit boundaries:** Administrative Office has discretion within population equality constraints
- **Timing of individual appointments within year:** President determines nomination timing within the designated year
- **Voluntary early senior service:** Any justice may transition before completing twelve years
- **Additional circuit judges:** Number determined by workload assessment, minimum of six per circuit
