# FEDERAL JUDICIAL BALANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

## A Bill to Modernize the Federal Judiciary, Establish Population-Based Judicial Circuits, Align Supreme Court Composition with Circuit Organization, and Ensure Balanced Representation

### Revision 1.6

---

## SECTION 1: SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act."

## SECTION 2: FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### (a) Findings

Congress finds that:

1. Article III of the Constitution vests judicial power in "one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish";

2. The Constitution provides that judges "shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour" and receive compensation that "shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office";

3. Congress has constitutional authority under Article III and the Necessary and Proper Clause to organize and structure the federal judiciary to ensure efficient administration of justice;

4. The current federal circuit system reflects historical boundaries rather than population distribution, creating unequal representation and workload disparities;

5. The Supreme Court has maintained nine justices since 1869, despite the creation of additional federal circuits and dramatic population growth;

6. The constitutional tradition of Supreme Court justices serving as circuit justices creates a direct representational relationship between regional circuits and the Supreme Court, with optimal judicial administration achieved when each regional circuit is served by one Supreme Court justice;

7. Regular and predictable judicial appointments promote constitutional balance and reduce partisan manipulation of the appointment process;

8. Clear definition of judicial duties and responsibilities promotes effective court administration and public confidence in the judiciary;

9. The Senate's "Advice and Consent" power is most effectively exercised when nominees possess robust and transparent records of legal reasoning available for public evaluation;

10. The current system creates arbitrary advantages for presidents based on actuarial chance rather than constitutional design;

11. The position of Chief Justice should rotate among justices as a capstone to distinguished service rather than concentrating administrative power in a single individual for decades;

12. A structured career path for Supreme Court justices -- progressing from Associate Justice to Chief Justice to Senior Justice -- provides clarity, dignity, and predictability while preserving life tenure under Article III;

13. Public confidence in the federal judiciary requires transparent and enforceable standards of ethical conduct applicable to all federal judges, including Justices of the Supreme Court;

14. Epistemic diversity -- incorporating the perspectives of career judges, legal scholars, experienced legislators, executive branch legal officers, and practitioners -- strengthens the Court's capacity to interpret law within a complex democratic society.

### (b) Purposes

The purposes of this Act are to:

1. Establish population-based federal judicial circuits to ensure equal representation;

2. Align Supreme Court composition with regional circuit organization to restore constitutional balance between Court size and judicial administration;

3. Create predictable and fair judicial appointment processes;

4. Define the duties and responsibilities of federal judicial offices;

5. Establish transparency and documentation requirements that ensure nominees possess evaluable records of legal reasoning;

6. Enhance transparency in the judicial appointment process;

7. Ensure optimal utilization of judicial experience and expertise;

8. Restore constitutional balance among the branches of government;

9. Diffuse the concentration of power in the Chief Justice position through automatic rotation;

10. Establish a dignified three-phase career structure for Supreme Court justices that removes the nation's constitutional future from dependence on individual justices' health and longevity;

11. Establish binding ethical standards and accountability mechanisms for the Supreme Court that preserve judicial independence while ensuring that no Justice is above the rule of law.

2. **Senior Justice** status begins upon completion of active service, with justices retaining full Article III protections and life tenure while serving in a reduced-duty capacity.

At steady state, the Court shall have fifteen justices in active service: fourteen in the Associate Justice phase and one in the Chief Justice phase.
