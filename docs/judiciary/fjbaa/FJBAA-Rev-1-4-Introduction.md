# Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

## Policy Introduction

### Published January 2025

Based on Rev 1.4 of the Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

---

The Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA) restructures the federal judiciary to address population-based representation, predictable appointments, and qualification standards. The Act reorganizes federal circuits according to population, aligns Supreme Court composition with circuit structure, and establishes transparent processes for judicial appointments.

The current federal circuit system reflects nineteenth-century boundaries rather than contemporary population distribution, creating significant workload disparities and unequal representation across regions. The Supreme Court has maintained nine justices since 1869 despite dramatic population growth and the addition of new circuits. Meanwhile, judicial appointments depend heavily on actuarial chance -- which justices happen to retire or die during which presidential terms -- rather than any principled constitutional design. The current system also creates perverse dynamics where the nation's constitutional future hinges on individual justices' health and longevity, forcing impossible choices on aging jurists and generating morbid national anxiety over their continued vitality.

FJBAA addresses these structural problems through five integrated reforms: circuit reorganization, Supreme Court composition aligned with circuit structure, a three-phase career structure for justices, automatic Chief Justice rotation, and enhanced qualification and transparency requirements.

## Key Components

**Title I: Federal Circuit Reorganization** establishes fifteen population-based regional circuits, each serving approximately equal populations as determined by the decennial census. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts draws boundaries ensuring no circuit serves more than 110% or less than 90% of the average circuit population. Boundaries rebalance following each census. The District of Columbia Circuit and Federal Circuit retain their specialized jurisdictions unchanged.

**Title II: Supreme Court Composition and Appointments** aligns the Supreme Court with circuit organization through fifteen justice positions corresponding to fifteen regional circuits. Each justice progresses through three phases: Associate Justice for years one through ten, Chief Justice for years eleven and twelve, and Senior Justice thereafter. At steady state, the Court has fifteen justices in active service -- fourteen in the Associate Justice phase and one in the Chief Justice phase. Each justice serves as circuit justice for an assigned regional circuit; the Chief Justice additionally covers the D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit. Senior Justices retain full Article III protections and life tenure while serving in a reduced-duty capacity. The Chief Justice position rotates automatically by seniority, ensuring every justice who completes a full term leads the Court. Once fully implemented, each presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities.

**Title III: Qualifications and Transparency** establishes minimum professional requirements for Supreme Court service: at least fifteen years of legal experience and five years as a federal appellate judge. Nominees must provide comprehensive documentation including professional biography, personal background statement, and judicial philosophy statement -- all publicly disclosed at least thirty days before confirmation hearings. A judicial qualifications panel reviews each nominee, and the Senate must complete consideration within 120 days.

**Title IV: Implementation and Fairness Provisions** phases the reforms over multiple years. Circuit reorganization takes effect approximately two years after enactment. Court composition alignment begins in the first odd-numbered year at least eighteen months after enactment and continues until all fifteen positions are filled. The regular replacement schedule and automatic Chief Justice rotation begin when justices appointed under the expansion schedule reach their eleventh year of active service. Constitutional protections are explicitly preserved: no sitting justice is removed, no judicial salary is reduced, and "good behavior" tenure remains intact. The Senior Justice provisions build on existing precedent in 28 U.S.C. Section 371.
