# FEDERAL JUDICIAL BALANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

## A Bill to Modernize the Federal Judiciary, Establish Population-Based Judicial Circuits, Expand the Supreme Court, and Ensure Balanced Representation

### Revision 1.3

---

## SECTION 1: SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act."

## SECTION 2: FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### (a) Findings

Congress finds that:

1. Article III of the Constitution vests judicial power in "one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish";

2. The Constitution provides that judges "shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour" and receive compensation that "shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office";

3. Congress has constitutional authority under Article III and the Necessary and Proper Clause to organize and structure the federal judiciary to ensure efficient administration of justice;

4. The current federal circuit system reflects historical boundaries rather than population distribution, creating unequal representation and workload disparities;

5. The Supreme Court has maintained nine justices since 1869, despite the creation of additional federal circuits and dramatic population growth;

6. The constitutional tradition of Supreme Court justices serving as circuit justices creates a direct representational relationship between regional circuits and the Supreme Court, with optimal judicial administration achieved when each regional circuit is served by one Supreme Court justice;

7. Regular and predictable judicial appointments promote constitutional balance and reduce partisan manipulation of the appointment process;

8. Clear definition of judicial duties and responsibilities promotes effective court administration and public confidence in the judiciary;

9. Transparent qualification standards enhance the legitimacy and quality of judicial appointments;

10. The current system creates arbitrary advantages for presidents based on actuarial chance rather than constitutional design;

11. The position of Chief Justice should rotate among justices as a capstone to distinguished service rather than concentrating administrative power in a single individual for decades;

12. A structured career path for Supreme Court justices -- progressing from Associate Justice to Chief Justice to Senior Justice -- provides clarity, dignity, and predictability while preserving life tenure under Article III.

### (b) Purposes

The purposes of this Act are to:

1. Establish population-based federal judicial circuits to ensure equal representation;

2. Align Supreme Court composition with regional circuit organization to restore constitutional balance between Court size and judicial administration;

3. Create predictable and fair judicial appointment processes;

4. Define the duties and responsibilities of federal judicial offices;

5. Establish minimum qualifications for judicial service;

6. Enhance transparency in the judicial appointment process;

7. Ensure optimal utilization of judicial experience and expertise;

8. Restore constitutional balance among the branches of government;

9. Diffuse the concentration of power in the Chief Justice position through automatic rotation;

10. Establish a dignified three-phase career structure for Supreme Court justices that removes the nation's constitutional future from dependence on individual justices' health and longevity.

## SECTION 3: DEFINITIONS

In this Act:

1. **"Associate Justice"** means a justice of the Supreme Court serving in the first ten years of active service, performing the regular duties of hearing and deciding cases before the Court;

2. **"Chief Justice"** means the justice of the Supreme Court serving in their eleventh and twelfth years of active service, who presides over the Court and serves as administrative head of the federal judiciary;

3. **"Senior Justice"** means a justice of the Supreme Court who has completed twelve years of active service and transitioned to senior status, retaining full Article III protections and life tenure while serving in a reduced-duty capacity;

4. **"Active service"** means service as an Associate Justice or Chief Justice, comprising the first twelve years of a justice's tenure on the Supreme Court;

5. **"Federal judge"** means any judge appointed under Article III of the Constitution;

6. **"Population-based circuit"** means a judicial circuit organized primarily according to population distribution rather than state boundaries;

7. **"Regional circuit"** means one of the fifteen numbered judicial circuits serving approximately equal populations across the United States.
