# Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

## Implementation Timeline

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 2.2 of the Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

---

## Timeline Overview

The Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA), hereafter "the Act," unfolds across three phases spanning approximately fifteen years from the first appointment to steady-state operation. The Act distinguishes between two temporal anchors: **enactment**, which triggers preparatory work, and **Year 1 of the Appointment Schedule**, which begins the expansion and replacement cycle. Year 1 falls in the first year of the presidential term following enactment, ensuring that the appointing president and Senate have received a mandate from the electorate after the Act becomes law.

The phased approach serves critical purposes: it spreads appointment opportunities across multiple administrations, allows the judicial system to absorb changes incrementally, and demonstrates successful operation before reaching full implementation.

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Preparatory Phase | Enactment through Year 1 | Circuit boundary development, ethics infrastructure, transparency requirements binding |
| Phase One: Circuit Reorganization | First January 1 at least 24 months after enactment | New circuit structure operational |
| Phase Two: Court Expansion | Years 1-11 | Full 15-member Court achieved by Year 11 |
| Phase Three: Three-Phase Career Structure | Year 11+ | Co-Chief Justice service begins Year 11; regular replacement begins Year 13 |
| Vacancy Coverage and Appointment Equalization | Year 1+ | Vacancy coverage roster active upon first Senior Justice; equalization begins Year 21 |
| Ethics Infrastructure | Enactment through Year 15+ | IG appointed within one year of enactment; Bridge Panel active until approximately Year 15 |
| Legacy Opt-In | Enactment+ | Slot schedule published upon enactment; elections open immediately |

## Effective Date Architecture

### Immediate Upon Enactment

**Transparency requirements and slate-based nomination take effect.** All provisions of Title III apply immediately to any Supreme Court justice nominated after the effective date. The slate-based nomination process (Section 202(a)) and BLOC STAR voting procedure (Section 202(b)) apply to all appointments under the Act, including expansion appointments. This includes:

- Slate nomination requirement (minimum 2 nominees per position, maximum 2.5 per position rounded up; 2-3 nominees for single-position expansion appointments)
- BLOC STAR voting procedure (senators score each nominee 0-5, aggregate scores determine selection)
- Slate rejection authority (threshold determined by Senate rules)
- Carryover nominee provisions (5-year eligibility, abbreviated hearings)
- Documentation requirements (10 self-selected works of substantial legal analysis per nominee)
- Six qualifying documentation pathways (judicial, scholarly, advocacy, legislative, executive, professional works)
- Subject matter diversity requirement (3 of 6 specified areas)
- Nominee statements (professional biography, 2,000-word judicial philosophy statement)
- Public disclosure requirements (72 hours for documentation)
- Senate Judiciary Committee completeness determination (14 days)
- 21-day public review period before hearings commence
- One full day of hearings per nominee (half-day for carryover nominees)
- 120-day Senate consideration timeline (BLOC STAR vote or slate rejection)

**Ethics provisions take effect.** The Code of Conduct for United States Judges becomes binding on all Supreme Court justices. Mandatory recusal documentation requirements (Section 502) apply immediately to all justices.

**Existing justices protected.** Justices serving on the effective date may continue in active service indefinitely, voluntarily elect Senior Justice status at any time, or elect to enter the Act's career structure through the voluntary opt-in mechanism (Section 403(d)). No sitting justice is removed; no salary is reduced.

**Administrative Office begins boundary development.** The 180-day clock for circuit boundary proposals begins.

**Appointment Schedule and opt-in slot schedule published.** The Administrative Office publishes the Appointment Schedule for each justice position and the schedule of available Co-Chief Justice slots for legacy opt-in elections under Section 403(d).

**Ethics infrastructure initiation.** The process for establishing the Ethics Review Panel and appointing the Judicial Inspector General begins.

### Within 180 Days of Enactment

**Circuit boundary development complete.** The Administrative Office of the United States Courts must:

- Divide national population into fifteen approximately equal segments
- Assign federal judicial districts to numbered regional circuits, prioritizing the assignment of all districts within a state to the same circuit; permitting division along federal judicial district boundaries where population equity within the tolerance band requires it
- Ensure no circuit serves more than 110% or less than 90% of average population
- Prioritize geographic contiguity where feasible
- Submit proposed boundaries for Congressional review

### Within One Year of Enactment

**First Judicial Inspector General appointed.** Per Section 508(d)(1):

- Nominating Committee convenes (Comptroller General or designee, two retired circuit chief judges by lottery, ABA president or designee)
- Committee identifies candidates meeting qualifications (15+ years Article III service or equivalent, no felony convictions, no political party leadership within 10 years, no close family relationship to sitting or recent justices)
- Committee submits three candidates to the Ethics Review Panel (or Bridge Panel if Panel not yet constituted)
- Panel selects Inspector General for ten-year non-renewable term

**Bridge Panel constituted (if needed).** If fewer than five Senior Justices are available:

- Administrative Office maintains roster of eligible retired circuit chief judges (15+ years Article III service)
- Clerk of the Supreme Court conducts public lottery to select Bridge Panel members
- Bridge Panel members serve until Senior Justices become available or matters are resolved

### First January 1 at Least 24 Months After Enactment

**New circuit structure takes effect.** The fifteen regional circuits become operational. This date allows:

- 18+ months for courts, states, and practitioners to prepare
- Time for additional circuit judge appointments
- Orderly reassignment of existing judges by primary residence
- Adjustment of case routing and administrative systems

### Within 180 Days of Ethics Review Panel Achieving Quorum

**Ethics Review Panel adopts initial rules of procedure.** Per Section 508(d)(3), the Panel must adopt rules addressing:

- Receiving and reviewing reports from the Inspector General
- Providing respondent justices with notice and opportunity to be heard
- Deliberation and decision-making procedures
- Issuance and publication of decisions

### Year 1 of the Appointment Schedule

**Court expansion begins.** The President submits the first nomination slate (2-3 nominees) and the Senate selects via BLOC STAR voting. Year 1 falls in the first year of the presidential term following enactment, ensuring:

- The preparatory phase (circuit reorganization, ethics infrastructure) is complete or well underway
- The appointing president and Senate have received a fresh electoral mandate
- Expansion begins on a predictable biennial schedule aligned with odd-numbered years of the Appointment Schedule

### Year 11 of the Appointment Schedule

**Co-Chief Justice service begins.** The first justices appointed under the expansion schedule commence their eleventh year of active service and automatically become Co-Chief Justices. This marks the beginning of the shared leadership model:

- Co-Chief Justice status attaches automatically upon commencing year eleven
- No separate nomination or confirmation required
- Co-Chief Justices share administrative responsibilities pursuant to Judicial Conference rules
- The President designates one Co-Chief Justice as Ceremonial Chief Justice
- Upon completing year twelve, each justice transitions to Senior Justice status

### Year 13 of the Appointment Schedule

**Regular replacement schedule begins.** The most senior justices appointed under the expansion schedule complete their Co-Chief Justice terms and transition to Senior Justice status, creating the first regular replacement vacancies. From this point forward:

- Justices transition from Co-Chief Justice to Senior Justice each odd-numbered year of the Appointment Schedule
- The appointment equalization mechanism (Section 202(d)) ensures each presidential term includes exactly five appointment opportunities once steady state is reached (Year 21)
- The vacancy coverage roster begins receiving expansion-appointed Senior Justices

**Transition period for Title V ends (approximately).** When five justices appointed under the expansion schedule have transitioned to Senior Justice status, the Bridge Panel mechanism is no longer needed:

- Ethics Review Panel consists entirely of Senior Justices
- En Banc Senior Body has sufficient membership for full appellate review
- Bridge Panel members complete service on any pending matters

---

## Preparatory Phase: Enactment Through Year 1

The preparatory phase begins upon enactment and continues until Year 1 of the Appointment Schedule. The duration of this phase depends on when during the presidential term the Act is enacted, but the Act guarantees at least the remainder of the enacting presidential term for preparation. Early enactment provides more preparation time; later enactment compresses the preparatory phase but still ensures all critical infrastructure is operational before expansion appointments begin.

### Upon Enactment

- Transparency requirements and slate-based nomination process apply to all future Supreme Court nominations
- Code of Conduct becomes binding on Supreme Court justices
- Mandatory recusal documentation requirements take effect
- Administrative Office begins circuit boundary development
- Administrative Office publishes Appointment Schedule and Co-Chief Justice slot schedule for legacy opt-in
- Existing justices may voluntarily elect Senior Justice status or file opt-in elections under Section 403(d)
- Ethics infrastructure establishment begins

### Boundary Development and Ethics Setup (First 180 Days)

- Administrative Office analyzes census data and population distribution at the federal judicial district level
- Draft boundaries developed using federal judicial districts as building blocks, prioritizing state unity and equal population with geographic contiguity
- Stakeholder consultation with federal courts, state governments, bar associations
- Circuit boundary proposal completed within 180 days
- Nominating Committee for Judicial Inspector General convenes
- Bridge Panel roster compiled by Administrative Office

### Continued Preparation (180 Days Through One Year)

- Congressional review of proposed boundaries
- Federal courts begin transition planning
- Circuit judge vacancy assessment conducted
- Appropriations process for implementation costs
- Inspector General nomination process continues
- Bridge Panel lottery conducted if needed
- First Judicial Inspector General appointed (deadline: one year after enactment)
- Office of the Judicial Inspector General established

### Pre-Appointment Readiness (One Year After Enactment Through Year 1)

- Additional circuit judge nominations as needed (minimum six per regional circuit)
- Court administrative systems updated for new circuit structure
- Case routing procedures revised
- Judicial reassignment notifications issued based on primary residence
- Inspector General office fully operational
- Complaint intake procedures established
- Ethics Review Panel (or Bridge Panel) adopts initial rules of procedure
- All systems ready for circuit reorganization

### Circuit Reorganization

On the first January 1 falling at least 24 months after enactment:

- Fifteen regional circuits become operational
- Federal judicial districts assigned to regional circuits per approved boundary plan
- Appeals proceed to appropriate regional circuits
- D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit continue unchanged

---

## Phase Two: Court Expansion (Years 1-11)

Court expansion proceeds gradually with one additional Associate Justice appointed each odd-numbered year of the Appointment Schedule. This distributes appointments across multiple administrations and prevents any single president from dominating the expanded Court.

### Expansion Schedule

| Year of Appointment Schedule | Appointment | Court Composition | Presidential Term |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Year 1 | 1st expansion | 10 members | 1st term after enactment |
| Year 3 | 2nd expansion | 11 members | 1st term after enactment |
| Year 5 | 3rd expansion | 12 members | 2nd term after enactment |
| Year 7 | 4th expansion | 13 members | 2nd term after enactment |
| Year 9 | 5th expansion | 14 members | 3rd term after enactment |
| Year 11 | 6th expansion | 15 members (full composition) | 3rd term after enactment |

### Expansion Phase Characteristics

**Distributed appointment opportunities.** Expansion appointments are distributed across at least three different presidential terms. No single president receives more than two expansion appointments unless they serve multiple terms.

**Transparency requirements and slate process apply throughout.** Every expansion appointment uses the slate-based process: the President submits a nomination slate (2-3 nominees for single-position expansion appointments), and the Senate selects via BLOC STAR voting. Each nominee must satisfy Title III requirements: 10 self-selected works of substantial legal analysis across six qualifying pathways, subject matter diversity, mandatory nominee statements, and 120-day Senate consideration timeline. Carryover nominees from prior slates may appear on subsequent expansion slates for up to five years from original documentation submission, with abbreviated half-day hearings.

**Existing justices unaffected by career structure.** Justices serving before the Act's effective date continue in active service. They are not subject to the three-phase career structure unless they elect opt-in under Section 403(d). Legacy Associate Justices who file opt-in elections are assigned to available Co-Chief Justice slots and transition according to their assigned schedule.

**Legacy Chief Justice transition period.** Until Co-Chief Justice service begins in Year 11, the Chief Justice serving on the effective date (the "Legacy Chief Justice") continues in that capacity, retaining all ceremonial functions and administrative authority. Once justices appointed under the Act reach their eleventh year and become Co-Chief Justices, they share administrative duties with the Legacy Chief Justice pursuant to Judicial Conference rules. The Legacy Chief Justice is not subject to the twelve-year active service limit and retains the title "Chief Justice of the United States" throughout their tenure. Upon the Legacy Chief Justice vacating office, the President designates a Ceremonial Chief Justice from among the serving Co-Chief Justices. If no Co-Chief Justice is serving when the Legacy Chief Justice vacates office, the President designates a Chief Justice from among sitting Associate Justices, subject to Senate confirmation, to serve until a justice appointed under the Act commences Co-Chief Justice service.

**Vacancy coverage available.** If any existing justice voluntarily elects Senior Justice status or an opt-in justice transitions, they become eligible for the vacancy coverage roster. Unexpected vacancies during the expansion phase are covered by Senior Justice rotation rather than additional presidential appointments.

**Ethics enforcement operational throughout.** The Inspector General receives and investigates complaints. The Ethics Review Panel (supplemented by Bridge Panel as needed) adjudicates findings and imposes sanctions.

---

## Phase Three: Three-Phase Career Structure and Regular Replacement (Year 11+)

Beginning eleven years after the first expansion appointment, the three-phase career structure becomes fully operational. Each justice progresses through Associate Justice (years 1-10), Co-Chief Justice (years 11-12), and Senior Justice (year 13+).

### Co-Chief Justice Service and Replacement Schedule

| Year of Appointment Schedule | Event | Notes |
|------------------------------|-------|-------|
| Year 11 | 1st Co-Chief Justice cohort | Justice appointed Year 1 becomes Co-Chief Justice (year 11) |
| Year 12 | Co-Chief service continues | Justice appointed Year 1 serves year 12 as Co-Chief Justice |
| Year 13 | 1st replacement; 2nd Co-Chief cohort | Justice appointed Year 1 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed Year 3 becomes Co-Chief Justice (year 11) |
| Year 14 | Co-Chief service continues | Justice appointed Year 3 serves year 12 as Co-Chief Justice |
| Year 15 | 2nd replacement; 3rd Co-Chief cohort | Justice appointed Year 3 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed Year 5 becomes Co-Chief Justice (year 11) |
| Year 16 | Co-Chief service continues | Justice appointed Year 5 serves year 12 as Co-Chief Justice |
| Year 17 | 3rd replacement; 4th Co-Chief cohort | Justice appointed Year 5 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed Year 7 becomes Co-Chief Justice (year 11) |
| Year 19 | 4th replacement; 5th Co-Chief cohort | Justice appointed Year 7 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed Year 9 becomes Co-Chief Justice (year 11) |
| Year 21 | 5th replacement; 6th Co-Chief cohort | Justice appointed Year 9 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed Year 11 becomes Co-Chief Justice (year 11) |
| Year 23 | 6th replacement | Justice appointed Year 11 transitions to Senior Justice |
| Year 25+ | Continuing cycle | Pattern continues indefinitely; appointment equalization ensures 5 per presidential term |

### Ethics Infrastructure Maturation

| Year of Appointment Schedule | Ethics Milestone | Notes |
|------------------------------|------------------|-------|
| Year 13 | 1st Senior Justice from expansion | First justice appointed under Act reaches Senior Justice status |
| Year 15 | 2nd Senior Justice from expansion | Two expansion-appointed Senior Justices available |
| Year 17 | 3rd Senior Justice from expansion | Three expansion-appointed Senior Justices available |
| Year 19 | 4th Senior Justice from expansion | Four expansion-appointed Senior Justices available |
| Year 21 | 5th Senior Justice from expansion; Transition period ends | Five expansion-appointed Senior Justices available; Bridge Panel no longer needed for Panel quorum |
| Year 23+ | Steady state | Ethics Review Panel consists entirely of Senior Justices |

### Steady-State Characteristics

**Predictable presidential opportunities.** Beginning in Year 21 of the Appointment Schedule, each four-year presidential term includes exactly five appointment opportunities. The appointment equalization mechanism (Section 202(d)) ensures this even distribution by redistributing appointments when the biennial schedule produces asymmetric clustering. The President submits nomination slates with the appropriate number of nominees (minimum two per position, maximum 2.5 per position rounded up), and the Senate selects via BLOC STAR voting.

**Three-phase career structure.** Each justice serves through three distinct phases:

- **Associate Justice (Years 1-10):** Hearing and deciding cases, full participation in Court deliberations
- **Co-Chief Justice (Years 11-12):** Sharing administrative leadership of the Court and federal judiciary, with one designated as Ceremonial Chief Justice
- **Senior Justice (Year 13+):** Reduced-duty status with full Article III protections and life tenure; eligible for Ethics Review Panel service and vacancy coverage rotation

**Two-year Co-Chief Justice terms.** Each justice serves as Co-Chief Justice for their final two years of active service (years eleven and twelve). Multiple Co-Chief Justices serve simultaneously, sharing administrative responsibilities pursuant to Judicial Conference rules. This provides sufficient time for administrative leadership while diffusing power that would otherwise concentrate in a single individual.

**Ceremonial Chief Justice designation.** The President designates one Co-Chief Justice to exercise constitutionally specified ceremonial functions -- presiding over presidential impeachment trials, administering the presidential oath of office -- for renewable two-year terms.

**Every justice serves as Co-Chief Justice.** Under the automatic eligibility system, every justice who completes a full term serves as Co-Chief Justice. The position becomes a capstone to distinguished service rather than a selective appointment based on presidential preference and actuarial chance.

**Vacancy coverage.** When unexpected vacancies occur during a justice's active service, Senior Justices fill the vacant seat through a random lottery rotation system per October Term. Vacancies do not create additional presidential appointment opportunities. The vacancy coverage roster grows as more Senior Justices accumulate, strengthening the system's capacity over time.

**Senior Justice status preserves Article III protections.** Transitioning justices retain full constitutional protections, salary, benefits, and life tenure. They may continue hearing cases, sit on circuit courts by designation, serve on the Ethics Review Panel, participate in vacancy coverage rotation, or decline discretionary assignments without penalty.

**Voluntary early transition permitted.** Any justice may elect Senior Justice status before completing ten years as Associate Justice, forgoing service as Co-Chief Justice and creating an immediate vacancy handled through Section 205. This provides flexibility while maintaining the regular schedule as the default.

**Ethics enforcement at full capacity.** With multiple Senior Justices available, the Ethics Review Panel operates with full Senior Justice membership. The En Banc Senior Body provides robust appellate review capacity. The Inspector General continues with ten-year terms providing institutional stability.

**Circuit compliance maintained through structured assessment.** The Administrative Office conducts population compliance assessments on a five-year cycle -- authoritative assessments within one year of each decennial census and interim assessments at the midpoint using American Community Survey data. A tiered response framework ensures circuit boundaries remain population-balanced: zero to one circuits outside the tolerance band requires no action; two circuits triggers contingency planning; three or more triggers mandatory rebalancing. If population growth eventually renders boundary adjustment insufficient, the Administrative Office reports to Congress for potential circuit count adjustment.

---

## Sequencing Requirements

Certain provisions must occur in sequence; others may proceed in parallel.

### Sequential Dependencies

1. **Boundary development must precede circuit reorganization.** The Administrative Office must complete population-based boundary proposals before new circuits can take effect.

2. **Circuit reorganization provides basis for Court expansion.** The principled justification for fifteen Associate Justices -- one per regional circuit -- requires the circuit structure to be established or underway before expansion begins.

3. **Expansion must precede regular replacement.** The twelve-year clock for Senior Justice transition begins only for justices appointed under the expansion schedule. Regular replacement cannot begin until at least twelve years after the first expansion appointment.

4. **Expansion must precede Co-Chief Justice service.** The eleven-year clock for Co-Chief Justice status begins only for justices appointed under the expansion schedule. Co-Chief Justice service cannot begin until at least eleven years after the first expansion appointment.

5. **Co-Chief Justice term precedes Senior Justice transition for each justice.** Each justice becomes Co-Chief Justice upon commencing year eleven, then transitions to Senior Justice upon completing year twelve. The Co-Chief Justice term immediately precedes the Senior Justice transition.

6. **Senior Justices must exist before vacancy coverage can operate.** The vacancy coverage roster consists of Senior Justices. Until at least one justice has transitioned to Senior Justice status (whether through the career structure, voluntary election, or legacy opt-in), no vacancy coverage rotation is possible.

7. **Inspector General appointment before full ethics operations.** While the Code of Conduct becomes binding immediately, investigation and adjudication of complaints requires the Inspector General to be appointed and the Ethics Review Panel (or Bridge Panel) to be constituted.

8. **Expansion-appointed Senior Justices must accumulate before Bridge Panel can retire.** The transition period for Title V ends only when five justices appointed under the expansion schedule have reached Senior Justice status, ensuring the Ethics Review Panel can function without Bridge Panel supplementation.

### Parallel Tracks

- **Transparency requirements, slate process, and circuit reorganization** proceed independently. Title III and the slate-based nomination provisions apply immediately while Title I phases in over the preparatory period.

- **Ethics enforcement and circuit reorganization** proceed independently. Title V takes effect immediately while Title I phases in over the preparatory period.

- **Circuit judge appointments and Supreme Court expansion** may proceed in parallel. Additional circuit judges for the reorganized circuits do not depend on Supreme Court composition.

- **Existing justice decisions** are independent. Sitting justices may voluntarily elect Senior Justice status at any time, or file opt-in elections under Section 403(d), without affecting the expansion or replacement schedule. Vacated seats are handled through Section 205 vacancy coverage.

- **Inspector General appointment and circuit boundary development** may proceed in parallel. Both occur within the first year of enactment but do not depend on each other.

- **Legacy opt-in elections and expansion appointments** proceed independently. Legacy justices may file elections at any time; their transitions are scheduled according to available Co-Chief Justice slots and do not affect the biennial expansion schedule.

## Illustrative Example

If the Act is enacted during the presidential term beginning in January 2029, Year 1 of the Appointment Schedule would fall in 2033 -- the first year of the following presidential term. Under this scenario, the preparatory phase would span 2029-2032 (circuit boundary development, ethics infrastructure, transition planning), and the expansion schedule would proceed: 2033, 2035, 2037, 2039, 2041, 2043. Co-Chief Justice service would begin in 2043 (Year 11), regular replacement in 2045 (Year 13), and steady-state operations by 2053 (Year 21). If enacted during a different presidential term, all dates shift accordingly while the internal structure remains identical.
