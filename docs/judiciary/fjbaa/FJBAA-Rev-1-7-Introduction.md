# Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

## Policy Introduction

### Published February 2025

Based on Rev 1.7 of the Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

---

The Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA) restructures the federal judiciary to address population-based representation, predictable appointments, transparent evaluation of nominees, and enforceable ethics. The Act reorganizes federal circuits according to population, aligns Supreme Court composition with circuit structure, establishes evidence-based documentation requirements ensuring nominees possess evaluable records, and creates binding ethical standards with meaningful enforcement mechanisms.

The current federal circuit system reflects nineteenth-century boundaries rather than contemporary population distribution, creating significant workload disparities and unequal representation across regions. The Supreme Court has maintained nine justices since 1869 despite dramatic population growth and the addition of new circuits. Meanwhile, judicial appointments depend heavily on actuarial chance -- which justices happen to retire or die during which presidential terms -- rather than any principled constitutional design. The current system also creates perverse dynamics where the nation's constitutional future hinges on individual justices' health and longevity, forcing impossible choices on aging jurists and generating morbid national anxiety over their continued vitality. And the Supreme Court remains the only court in the federal system without binding ethical rules or meaningful enforcement mechanisms -- a gap that has undermined public confidence as controversies over undisclosed gifts, travel, and financial relationships have accumulated.

FJBAA addresses these structural problems through six integrated reforms: circuit reorganization, Supreme Court composition aligned with circuit structure, a three-phase career structure for justices, automatic Chief Justice rotation, evidence-based transparency requirements, and binding ethics enforcement. The Act's title reflects its dual focus: "Balance" (equal representation, predictable appointments, diffused power) and "Accountability" (enforceable ethical standards with meaningful sanctions).

## Key Components

**Title I: Federal Circuit Reorganization** establishes fifteen population-based regional circuits, each serving approximately equal populations as determined by the decennial census. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts draws boundaries ensuring no circuit serves more than 110% or less than 90% of the average circuit population. Boundaries rebalance following each census. The District of Columbia Circuit and Federal Circuit retain their specialized jurisdictions unchanged.

**Title II: Supreme Court Composition and Appointments** aligns the Supreme Court with circuit organization through fifteen justice positions progressing through a three-phase career structure. Justices serve through three distinct phases: Associate Justice for years one through ten, Chief Justice for years eleven and twelve, and Senior Justice thereafter. This structure provides clarity and predictability -- every justice appointed under the Act knows exactly what their career arc will look like. Senior Justices retain full Article III protections and life tenure while serving in a reduced-duty capacity. The Chief Justice position rotates automatically by seniority, ensuring every justice who completes a full term leads the Court and diffusing power that would otherwise concentrate in a single individual for decades. Once fully implemented, each presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities.

**Title III: Transparency and Evaluative Standards for Nominations** establishes documentation requirements ensuring nominees possess comprehensive evaluable records. Nominees must submit at least fifty works of substantial legal analysis, which may include judicial opinions, scholarly publications, appellate briefs, legislative analysis, executive branch legal memoranda, or professional legal opinions. This documentation must address at least three of six specified subject areas (constitutional structure, individual rights, federal jurisdiction, statutory interpretation, administrative law, or criminal law). Nominees provide a professional biography and a judicial philosophy statement of at least 5,000 words. All documentation becomes publicly available within 72 hours of receipt, with a minimum 45-day deliberation period before the confirmation vote. The Senate Judiciary Committee determines documentation completeness within 14 days and must complete consideration within 120 days. Congressional findings affirm that epistemic diversity strengthens the Court, and the Act explicitly preserves the President's constitutional authority to nominate any person.

**Title IV: Implementation and Fairness Provisions** phases the reforms over multiple years. Circuit reorganization takes effect approximately two years after enactment. Court composition alignment begins in the first odd-numbered year at least eighteen months after enactment and continues until full composition is achieved. The regular replacement schedule and automatic Chief Justice rotation begin when justices appointed under the expansion schedule reach their eleventh year of active service. Constitutional protections are explicitly preserved: no sitting justice is removed, no judicial salary is reduced, and "good behavior" tenure remains intact. The Senior Justice provisions build on existing precedent in 28 U.S.C. Section 371.

**Title V: Judicial Ethics and Accountability** establishes binding ethical standards and enforcement for the Supreme Court. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges applies to all justices, with compliance mandatory. An Ethics Review Panel of five Senior Justices adjudicates complaints, with an independent Judicial Inspector General (ten-year term, unanimous-vote removal protection) conducting investigations. Sanctions range from private admonition to mandatory early transition to Senior Justice status, with serious sanctions requiring a four-of-five supermajority to prevent partisan weaponization. Mandatory Early Transition may be imposed only for enumerated objective violations -- undisclosed financial interests, conflicts of interest, ex parte contacts, false statements, acceptance of substantial undisclosed benefits -- not for disfavored judicial philosophies. Robust due process protections and en banc appellate review by all Senior Justices ensure fairness. During the transition period before sufficient Senior Justices are available, a Bridge Panel of retired circuit chief judges selected by lottery provides immediate capacity.
