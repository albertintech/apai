# FEDERAL JUDICIAL BALANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

## A Bill to Modernize the Federal Judiciary, Establish Population-Based Judicial Circuits, Align Supreme Court Composition with Circuit Organization, and Ensure Balanced Representation

### Revision 2.2

---

## SECTION 1: SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act."

## SECTION 2: FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### (a) Findings

Congress finds that:

1. Article III of the Constitution vests judicial power in "one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish";

2. The Constitution provides that judges "shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour" and receive compensation that "shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office";

3. Congress has constitutional authority under Article III and the Necessary and Proper Clause to organize and structure the federal judiciary to ensure efficient administration of justice;

4. The current federal circuit system reflects historical boundaries rather than population distribution, creating unequal representation and workload disparities;

5. The Supreme Court has maintained nine justices since 1869, despite the creation of additional federal circuits and dramatic population growth;

6. The constitutional tradition of Supreme Court justices serving as circuit justices creates a direct representational relationship between regional circuits and the Supreme Court, with optimal judicial administration achieved when each regional circuit is served by one Supreme Court justice;

7. Regular and predictable judicial appointments promote constitutional balance and reduce partisan manipulation of the appointment process;

8. Clear definition of judicial duties and responsibilities promotes effective court administration and public confidence in the judiciary;

9. The Senate's "Advice and Consent" power is most effectively exercised when nominees possess robust and transparent records of legal reasoning available for public evaluation, and when the Senate selects from among multiple qualified candidates rather than rendering a binary judgment on a single nominee;

10. The current system creates arbitrary advantages for presidents based on actuarial chance rather than constitutional design;

11. The position of Chief Justice should be shared among justices as a capstone to distinguished service rather than concentrating administrative power in a single individual for decades;

12. A structured career path for Supreme Court justices -- progressing from Associate Justice to Co-Chief Justice to Senior Justice -- provides clarity, dignity, and predictability while preserving life tenure under Article III;

13. Public confidence in the federal judiciary requires transparent and enforceable standards of ethical conduct applicable to all federal judges, including Justices of the Supreme Court;

14. Epistemic diversity -- incorporating the perspectives of career judges, legal scholars, experienced legislators, executive branch legal officers, and practitioners -- strengthens the Court's capacity to interpret law within a complex democratic society;

15. A slate-based nomination process in which the President presents multiple qualified candidates and the Senate selects from among them transforms the confirmation process from an adversarial gatekeeping function into a collaborative selection function, reducing partisan obstruction incentives while preserving both presidential nomination authority and Senate advice and consent;

16. Scored voting methods that permit senators to express degrees of support across multiple nominees produce outcomes more reflective of collective Senate judgment than binary confirmation votes on individual nominees.

### (b) Purposes

The purposes of this Act are to:

1. Establish population-based federal judicial circuits to ensure equal representation;

2. Align Supreme Court composition with regional circuit organization to restore constitutional balance between Court size and judicial administration;

3. Create predictable and fair judicial appointment processes;

4. Define the duties and responsibilities of federal judicial offices;

5. Establish transparency and documentation requirements that ensure nominees possess evaluable records of legal reasoning;

6. Enhance transparency in the judicial appointment process;

7. Ensure optimal utilization of judicial experience and expertise;

8. Restore constitutional balance among the branches of government;

9. Diffuse the concentration of power in the Chief Justice position through shared leadership among Co-Chief Justices;

10. Establish a dignified three-phase career structure for Supreme Court justices that removes the nation's constitutional future from dependence on individual justices' health and longevity;

11. Establish binding ethical standards and accountability mechanisms for the Supreme Court that preserve judicial independence while ensuring that no Justice is above the rule of law;

12. Replace the binary single-nominee confirmation model with a slate-based selection process that structurally incentivizes cooperation between the President and the Senate while preventing partisan obstruction of judicial appointments.

## TITLE I: FEDERAL CIRCUIT REORGANIZATION

### Section 101. Establishment of Population-Based Judicial Circuits

#### (a) Circuit Structure

The United States shall be divided into fifteen judicial circuits for the administration of federal justice, organized as follows:

1. **Fifteen Regional Circuits** numbered First through Fifteenth, each serving approximately equal populations as determined by the most recent decennial census;

2. **District of Columbia Circuit** retaining specialized jurisdiction over federal regulatory, administrative, and governmental matters;

3. **Federal Circuit** retaining specialized jurisdiction over patents, international trade, federal employment, and appeals from specialized federal courts.

#### (b) Population-Based Boundaries

The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall, within 180 days of enactment:

1. Divide the national population (excluding territories) into fifteen approximately equal segments;

2. Assign each segment to a numbered circuit, prioritizing geographic contiguity where feasible;

3. Assign federal judicial districts to circuits, prioritizing the assignment of all districts within a State to the same circuit; provided that where population equity within the tolerance band established in this section cannot otherwise be achieved, districts within the same State may be assigned to different circuits. For purposes of this paragraph, "federal judicial districts" means the judicial districts established under 28 U.S.C. Sections 81-131 and the District of Columbia. No subdivision of a federal judicial district shall be authorized under this section;

4. File proposed boundaries with Congress for review.

#### (c) Compliance Assessment and Boundary Adjustment

(1) Assessment Schedule. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall conduct a population compliance assessment of all regional circuits at two intervals:

   (A) Within one year following each decennial census, using decennial census data (authoritative assessment);

   (B) At the approximate midpoint between decennial censuses, using the most recent American Community Survey 5-year estimates published by the Census Bureau (interim assessment).

(2) Compliance Measurement. For each assessment, the Administrative Office shall determine the number of regional circuits whose population falls outside the tolerance band established in this section -- that is, more than ten percent above or below the average regional circuit population as calculated from the applicable population data.

(3) Tiered Response. The Administrative Office shall take the following action based on the number of regional circuits falling outside the tolerance band:

   (A) Zero or one circuits outside the tolerance band: No action required;

   (B) Two circuits outside the tolerance band: The Administrative Office shall prepare contingency boundary proposals for consideration upon the next assessment;

   (C) Three or more circuits outside the tolerance band: The Administrative Office shall initiate boundary adjustment proceedings under paragraph (4), targeting restoration to no more than two circuits outside the tolerance band.

(4) Boundary Adjustment Proceedings. When mandatory rebalancing is triggered under paragraph (3)(C), the Administrative Office shall propose revised boundaries within 180 days, applying the principles of subsection (b). Proposed boundaries shall be filed with Congress for review consistent with the process established for initial boundary-drawing under subsection (b)(4).

#### (d) Circuit Count Adjustment

(1) Principle. The number of regional circuits established under this section is derived from the application of the organizing principles of subsection (b) to current population distribution. The number is not permanently fixed; it follows from principled application to demographic reality.

(2) Trigger. When the Administrative Office determines, in the course of a compliance assessment under subsection (c), that boundary adjustments alone cannot restore compliance to no more than two circuits outside the tolerance band, the Administrative Office shall report to Congress:

   (A) The finding that boundary adjustment is insufficient to restore compliance;

   (B) An analysis of the minimum number of additional circuits required to restore compliance consistent with the principles of subsection (b);

   (C) Proposed boundaries for the expanded circuit system.

(3) Congressional Authorization Required. The creation of additional circuits and corresponding adjustment to Supreme Court composition under Title II shall require an act of Congress. Nothing in this subsection authorizes the Administrative Office or the Judicial Conference to create new circuits without congressional authorization.

#### (e) Population Data Standards

(1) "Decennial census" as used in this section refers to the population count conducted pursuant to Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and 13 U.S.C. Section 141.

(2) "American Community Survey 5-year estimates" as used in this section refers to the population estimates published by the Census Bureau pursuant to 13 U.S.C. Section 182, aggregated over five consecutive years.

(3) Population figures for purposes of this section shall include all persons residing within the geographic boundaries of the regional circuits, consistent with the methodology used for apportionment of Representatives under 2 U.S.C. Section 2a.

### Section 102. Circuit Court Organization

#### (a) Minimum Judge Requirements

Each regional circuit court of appeals shall have not fewer than six active judges.

#### (b) District Court Assignment

All existing district courts shall be assigned to the regional circuit to which the corresponding federal judicial district is assigned under Section 101(b).

---

## TITLE II: SUPREME COURT COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE

### Section 201. Supreme Court Composition

#### (a) Number of Justices

The Supreme Court of the United States shall consist of fifteen justice positions. Each justice position progresses through a three-phase career structure: Associate Justice (years 1-10), Co-Chief Justice (years 11-12), and Senior Justice (year 13+). At steady state, the Court consists of Associate Justices and Co-Chief Justices totaling fifteen active justices.

#### (b) Alignment with Circuits

The Supreme Court composition reflects:

1. Fifteen regional judicial circuits, each corresponding to one justice position;

2. Restoration of the constitutional relationship between circuit organization and Supreme Court size, whereby each regional circuit is served by one circuit justice;

3. The Ceremonial Chief Justice, in addition to their assigned regional circuit, provides circuit justice coverage for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Federal Circuit.

#### (c) Phased Expansion Schedule

The Court shall expand gradually according to the following timeline:

1. **Initial Expansion (Years 1-6)**: One additional justice appointed in each odd-numbered year until all fifteen justice positions are filled;

2. **Regular Replacement (Year 13+)**: Beginning twelve years after the first appointment under this Act, one justice completes active service and transitions to Senior Justice each odd-numbered year;

3. **Steady State**: Once fully implemented, each presidential term includes five appointment opportunities as provided in Section 202(d).

### Section 202. Appointment Process

#### (a) Slate Nomination

1. The President shall, for each biennial appointment cycle, submit to the Senate a nomination slate consisting of multiple nominees for available justice positions;

4. Each nominee on the slate shall satisfy the documentation requirements of Title III;

5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the President's authority under Article II to include any person of the President's choosing on a nomination slate.

#### (b) Senate Selection by BLOC STAR Voting

1. The Senate shall select justices from the nomination slate using the following scored voting procedure:

   - (A) Each senator shall assign to each nominee on the slate a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, where 0 indicates no support and 5 indicates the strongest support;

   - (B) Each senator's scores for all nominees on the slate shall be recorded and published as part of the public record;

   - (C) Scores shall be summed across all voting senators to produce an aggregate score for each nominee;

   - (D) The nominees with the highest aggregate scores equal to the number of available positions shall be provisionally selected;

   - (E) If any provisionally selected nominee's aggregate score does not exceed the aggregate score of any non-selected nominee by a margin established under rules adopted by the Senate, an automatic runoff shall be conducted between the tied or near-tied nominees using the same scoring procedure;

   - (F) The nominees receiving the highest aggregate scores following any necessary runoff shall be confirmed to fill the available positions;

2. A nominee confirmed under this subsection shall be deemed to have received the advice and consent of the Senate for purposes of Article II of the Constitution;

3. No separate floor vote on individual nominees shall be required when selection is made through the procedure established in this subsection.

#### (c) Slate Rejection

1. In lieu of conducting the BLOC STAR voting procedure under subsection (b), the Senate may reject a nomination slate in its entirety;

2. The threshold and procedures for entire-slate rejection shall be determined by the Senate under its constitutional authority to determine the rules of its proceedings;

3. If the Senate rejects a nomination slate, the President shall submit a new nomination slate within thirty (30) days;

4. No nominee who appeared on a rejected slate shall be eligible for inclusion on the immediately subsequent slate. Such nominees may appear on later slates subject to the provisions of this section and Section 202(f).

#### (d) Appointment Equalization

1. When the Appointment Schedule produces three consecutive odd-numbered years in which three positions each become available, one position from the first such year shall be filled by the President serving in the fourth year of the preceding presidential term;

2. A justice appointed under paragraph (1) shall commence active service in accordance with Section 206, upon the vacancy of the position to which they were appointed;

3. Beginning in Year 21 of the Appointment Schedule, each four-year presidential term includes five appointment opportunities.

#### (e) Schedule Publication

The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall maintain and publish an Appointment Schedule for each justice position consistent with this section. The Schedule shall identify each position's appointment cycle and shall be updated to reflect any changes resulting from legacy seat synchronization under Section 403.

#### (f) Carryover Nominees

1. A nominee who appeared on a prior nomination slate but was not selected may be included on a subsequent nomination slate at the President's discretion, subject to the following conditions:

   - (A) No more than five (5) years shall have elapsed since the date of the nominee's original submission of documentation under Title III;

   - (B) The nominee shall submit an updated professional biography reflecting any changes in employment, judicial service, or other professional activities since the prior nomination;

2. The Senate Judiciary Committee shall conduct an abbreviated hearing of no more than one half-day for each carryover nominee, focused on developments since the nominee's prior appearance;

3. Carryover eligibility is measured from the date of original submission of documentation to the Senate, regardless of how many subsequent slates the nominee has appeared on;

4. A nominee whose carryover eligibility has expired must complete the full documentation and hearing process under Title III to appear on any subsequent slate.

#### (g) Senate Consideration Timeline

The Senate shall act on a nomination slate -- either by conducting the BLOC STAR voting procedure under subsection (b) or by rejecting the slate under subsection (c) -- within one hundred twenty (120) days of receiving the slate.

#### (h) Predictable Appointment Schedule

1. One justice position becomes available each odd-numbered year;

2. The most senior justice appointed under this Act's expansion schedule transitions to Senior Justice;

3. Each four-year presidential term includes five appointment opportunities as equalized under subsection (d).

### Section 203. Three-Phase Justice Career Structure

#### (a) Associate Justice (Years 1-10)

Upon appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court, a justice serves as Associate Justice for ten years, during which they:

1. Hear and decide cases before the Supreme Court;

4. Serve as circuit justice for an assigned regional circuit.

#### (b) Co-Chief Justice (Years 11-12)

Upon commencing their eleventh year of active service, a justice becomes a Co-Chief Justice and serves in that capacity until transitioning to Senior Justice upon completion of their twelfth year. Co-Chief Justices:

#### (d) Voluntary Early Transition

Any Associate Justice may elect to transition directly to Senior Justice before completing ten years of active service, forgoing service as Co-Chief Justice. A voluntary early transition creates a vacancy in the justice's seat, which shall be addressed pursuant to Section 205.

### Section 204. Co-Chief Justice Provisions

#### (a) Automatic Eligibility

Co-Chief Justice status attaches automatically upon a justice commencing their eleventh year of active service. No nomination, confirmation, or other action is required.

#### (d) Incapacity or Vacancy

1. If the Ceremonial Chief Justice is temporarily unable to perform ceremonial duties, the Co-Chief Justice with the longest tenure in active service shall serve as Acting Ceremonial Chief Justice;

2. If only one Co-Chief Justice is serving, that justice shall exercise all functions of the Ceremonial Chief Justice until a second Co-Chief Justice commences service;

1. Dies;

2. Is removed from office by impeachment and conviction;

3. Becomes permanently incapacitated as determined under procedures established by the Judicial Conference of the United States;

4. Is subject to Mandatory Early Transition under Section 506; or

5. Elects voluntary early transition to Senior Justice under Section 203(d).

6. No Senior Justice shall be eligible for selection in consecutive lotteries for the same vacant seat unless all other eligible Senior Justices on the vacancy coverage roster have served one rotation for that vacancy or have been excused under subsection (e). Once all eligible Senior Justices have served, the full roster resets and all eligible Senior Justices become available for selection again;

7. If only one Senior Justice is available on the vacancy coverage roster, that Senior Justice shall serve in the vacant seat for each October Term until another Senior Justice becomes available or the next regularly scheduled appointment for the seat occurs;

8. If a vacancy occurs during an October Term already in progress, the Administrative Office shall conduct the lottery and assign a Senior Justice within thirty (30) days. The assigned Senior Justice shall serve for the remainder of that October Term, and a new lottery shall be conducted before the next October Term begins.

#### (d) Duration of Vacancy Coverage

1. Vacancy coverage rotation for a seat shall continue until the seat is filled by a justice appointed and confirmed through the regular appointment process under Section 202 at the seat's next regularly scheduled biennial appointment;

2. No vacancy coverage rotation shall extend beyond one full twelve-year cycle for a single seat. If the regular appointment process fails to fill the seat at the next scheduled interval, the seat shall remain vacant until the subsequent scheduled interval;

3. Upon confirmation of a new justice to the seat, all rotation assignments for that seat shall conclude, except that any Senior Justice who has heard oral argument in a pending case shall retain participation rights in that case under subsection (c)(5).

#### (e) Health and Incapacity Exemption

1. A Senior Justice may petition the Administrative Office for exemption from the vacancy coverage roster on grounds of physical or mental health, or age-related incapacity;

2. The Administrative Office shall grant such petitions upon submission of a certification from a licensed physician attesting that active-service duties would be medically inadvisable;

3. A Senior Justice excused under this subsection may petition for reinstatement to the roster at any time;

4. Exemption from the vacancy coverage roster shall not affect a Senior Justice's status, compensation, tenure, or eligibility for other duties under Section 203(c).

#### (f) No Presidential Appointment for Vacancies

1. A vacancy under subsection (b) shall not create an additional appointment opportunity for the President outside the regular biennial schedule;

2. The President shall submit a nomination slate for the vacant seat in the odd-numbered year that constitutes the seat's next regularly scheduled appointment under Section 202(h);

3. The justice appointed to fill a vacant seat enters the regular twelve-year career structure under Section 203, with Year 1 of active service commencing upon confirmation. The seat's biennial appointment cadence is unaffected; the seat's subsequent scheduled appointment occurs twelve years after the new justice's confirmation, which by operation of the biennial schedule will fall in the same odd-numbered year cycle as originally established.

#### (g) Multiple Simultaneous Vacancies

1. If more than one vacancy exists simultaneously, the Administrative Office shall establish a separate vacancy coverage rotation for each vacant seat;

2. No Senior Justice shall serve on more than one vacancy coverage rotation simultaneously. The Administrative Office shall allocate available Senior Justices across the rotations as evenly as practicable;

3. If the vacancy coverage roster is exhausted -- that is, fewer Senior Justices are available than there are vacant seats requiring coverage -- uncovered seats shall remain vacant until either a Senior Justice becomes available or the next regularly scheduled appointment fills the seat;

4. The Court shall continue to operate and decide cases with whatever number of active justices and rotation-assigned Senior Justices are available. No minimum quorum beyond that required by existing law shall be imposed by this section.

#### (h) Administrative Provisions

1. The Administrative Office shall maintain the vacancy coverage roster and publish it annually;

2. The Administrative Office shall establish procedures for notification, scheduling, and transition of rotation assignments;

3. Rotation assignments shall be published on the Court's calendar with sufficient advance notice to permit preparation by the assigned Senior Justice;

4. The Administrative Office shall report annually to the Judicial Conference on the operation of the vacancy coverage system, including the number of vacancies, the composition of the roster, and any exemptions granted.

### Section 206. Oath of Office and Commencement of Service

#### (a) Oath Required

Each justice shall take the oath of office prescribed by law before commencing active service on the Supreme Court.

#### (b) Administration of Oath

The oath of office shall be administered by the Ceremonial Chief Justice, or in the absence or incapacity of the Ceremonial Chief Justice, by the Co-Chief Justice with the longest tenure in active service, or if no Co-Chief Justice is available, by the Associate Justice with the longest tenure in active service.

#### (c) Mutual Oath Requirement

When two or more justices are confirmed to commence active service in the same year, they shall be sworn in during the same ceremony. No oath of office administered to a justice commencing service in that year shall be valid unless all justices confirmed to commence service in that year are present and sworn at the same ceremony.

#### (d) Exception for Death, Incapacity, or Withdrawal

Subsection (c) shall not apply with respect to a confirmed justice who, prior to the oath ceremony:

1. Dies;

2. Becomes permanently incapacitated as determined under procedures established by the Judicial Conference of the United States; or

3. Withdraws from the appointment.

#### (e) Commencement of Active Service

A justice's active service, and the twelve-year period established under Section 203, commences upon taking the oath of office.

#### (f) Timing

Justices confirmed to fill positions becoming available in an odd-numbered year shall take the oath of office after the positions are vacated by the outgoing justices' transition to Senior Justice and before the first oral argument of the October Term beginning in that year.

## TITLE III: TRANSPARENCY AND EVALUATIVE STANDARDS FOR NOMINATIONS

### Section 301. Congressional Findings

Congress finds that:

1. The "Advice and Consent" power of the Senate is most effectively exercised when a nominee possesses a robust and transparent record of legal reasoning available for public evaluation;

2. Epistemic diversity -- incorporating the perspectives of career judges, legal scholars, experienced legislators, and executive branch legal officers -- strengthens the Court's capacity to interpret law within a complex democratic society;

3. Requiring documented evidence of sustained legal reasoning ensures that a nominee's judicial philosophy is grounded in a demonstrated history of analysis rather than undisclosed commitments or confirmation hearing performance;

4. Nothing in this Title shall be construed to limit the President's authority under Article II to nominate any person of the President's choosing to the Supreme Court;

5. Documentation requirements calibrated to enable Senate evaluation of multiple nominees simultaneously serve both the transparency goals of this Title and the selection process established in Section 202.

### Section 302. Nomination Documentation Requirements

#### (a) Required Submission

The President shall submit to the Senate, concurrently with any nomination slate under Section 202(a), a comprehensive record for each nominee demonstrating the nominee's legal reasoning and constitutional philosophy. Each nominee's record shall consist of no fewer than ten (10) distinct works of substantial legal analysis authored or primarily drafted by the nominee, self-selected by the nominee as representative of the nominee's best and most characteristic legal reasoning.

#### (b) Qualifying Documentation

The submission required under subsection (a) may include any combination of the following:

1. **Judicial Works:** Opinions, orders, concurrences, or dissents -- published or unpublished -- from any federal or state court of record;

2. **Scholarly Works:** Legal scholarship published in peer-reviewed journals, law reviews, edited volumes, or academic treatises, and scholarly books on legal subjects;

3. **Advocacy Works:** Legal briefs, substantive motions, or petitions filed in federal appellate courts, the Supreme Court of the United States, or the highest court of any State;

8. Slots for which no election has been filed shall remain available until the calendar date of the slot has passed, at which point the slot expires;

10. An electing justice who commences service as Co-Chief Justice under this subsection shall be eligible for designation as Ceremonial Chief Justice under Section 204(b) on the same terms as any other Co-Chief Justice.
