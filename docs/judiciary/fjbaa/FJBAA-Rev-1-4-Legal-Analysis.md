# Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

## Legal Analysis

### Published January 2025

Based on Rev 1.4 of the Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

---

## Introduction

The Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA), hereafter "the Act," exercises congressional authority to reorganize the federal judiciary. While Congress has changed the size of the Supreme Court seven times and reorganized circuit boundaries repeatedly throughout American history, the Act's combination of reforms -- circuit reorganization, Court composition alignment, three-phase career structure, automatic Chief Justice rotation, and qualification requirements -- will face legal challenges. This analysis examines the constitutional basis for each major provision, identifies likely litigation theories, and assesses the Act's prospects for surviving judicial review.

The central conclusion is that the Act operates within Congress's established constitutional authority under Article III and the Necessary and Proper Clause. The most significant legal question -- whether the Senior Justice mechanism preserves "good behavior" tenure -- has a strong textual and precedential basis, though it presents a question of first impression at the Supreme Court level. The automatic Chief Justice rotation presents minimal additional legal risk because it regulates duty assignments within continued judicial office, not tenure itself.

## Constitutional Authority to Organize the Judiciary

### Textual Foundation

Article III, Section 1 provides: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."

This language grants Congress broad authority over judicial organization. The Constitution mandates "one supreme Court" but leaves its size, structure, and procedures to congressional determination. The phrase "from time to time ordain and establish" for inferior courts confirms that judicial organization is an ongoing congressional function, not a one-time constitutional settlement.

The Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18) supplements this authority, empowering Congress "to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution" constitutional powers -- including the judicial power vested by Article III.

### Historical Practice

Congress has exercised this authority continuously since 1789:

**Judiciary Act of 1789:** Established the initial federal court system, including circuit courts and district courts. Set Supreme Court membership at six justices.

**Circuit reorganizations:** Congress has reorganized circuit boundaries repeatedly -- in 1801, 1802, 1837, 1863, 1866, 1891, 1929, 1980, and 1981 among other instances. The current circuit structure reflects accumulated statutory changes, not constitutional mandate.

**Supreme Court size changes:** Congress has changed the number of justices seven times: from six (1789) to five (1801) to six (1802) to seven (1807) to nine (1837) to ten (1863) to seven (1866) to nine (1869). Each change occurred through ordinary legislation.

**Senior status for judges:** Congress created senior status for Article III judges in 1919 and has modified the provisions repeatedly. Current law (28 U.S.C. Section 371) allows judges meeting age and service requirements to take senior status while retaining Article III protections.

This historical practice confirms that judicial organization is a legislative function. No court has held that Congress lacks authority to change the Supreme Court's size or reorganize the circuit system.

### Limits on Congressional Authority

Congressional power over judicial organization is broad but not unlimited. Article III imposes two explicit constraints:

**Tenure protection:** Judges "shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour." Congress cannot remove judges except through impeachment.

**Compensation protection:** Judicial compensation "shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office." Congress cannot reduce sitting judges' salaries.

The Act respects both constraints. No sitting justice is removed from office. No judicial salary is reduced. Justices transitioning to Senior Justice status retain their Article III status, full compensation, and life tenure.

## Supreme Court Composition Alignment

### Constitutional Basis

The Constitution does not specify how many justices shall serve on the Supreme Court. The number is determined by statute and has changed seven times. Congress's authority to set Supreme Court membership is uncontested.

### Principled Basis vs. "Court Packing"

While Congress clearly has authority to change the Court's size, the Act's political viability depends on distinguishing principled composition alignment from partisan court-packing.

Court-packing -- adding seats solely to change case outcomes -- triggered a constitutional crisis in 1937 when President Roosevelt proposed expanding the Court to overcome resistance to New Deal legislation. The proposal failed politically despite its technical legality, and the episode remains a cautionary example of legitimate authority exercised for illegitimate purposes.

The Act provides a principled basis for Court size: alignment with circuit organization. Historically, Supreme Court membership corresponded to the number of judicial circuits, reflecting justices' duty to "ride circuit" and hear cases in regional courts. Six justices served six circuits; nine justices served nine circuits. The Act restores this relationship: fifteen justice positions for fifteen regional circuits.

This structural justification -- unlike simple court-packing -- provides a limiting principle. The Court cannot expand indefinitely because its size is tied to circuit organization, not partisan convenience. Future Congresses seeking to add positions would need to justify additional circuits, constraining political manipulation.

### Circuit Justice Assignments

The Act assigns each justice to serve as circuit justice for one regional circuit, providing circuit justice coverage for emergency applications and administrative oversight. The Chief Justice additionally covers the D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit -- specialized circuits that exist for subject-matter jurisdiction rather than population representation and therefore do not independently justify Supreme Court positions.

This assignment structure reinforces the principled basis for Court composition: the number of positions derives from the number of regional circuits requiring circuit justice coverage, not from any desired ideological outcome.

### Phased Implementation

The Act's gradual expansion -- one justice per odd-numbered year -- further distinguishes it from court-packing. The expansion phase spans multiple administrations, distributing appointment opportunities across different presidents regardless of party. No single administration receives a windfall of appointments.

## Three-Phase Career Structure and "Good Behavior" Tenure

### The Central Legal Question

The Act's most significant legal innovation is the three-phase career structure: Associate Justice for years one through ten, Chief Justice for years eleven and twelve, and Senior Justice thereafter. These are phases within a single justice position, not separate offices. This mechanism creates predictable vacancies without formal term limits.

The constitutional question is whether the Senior Justice transition preserves "good behavior" tenure as required by Article III, Section 1.

### Textual Analysis

Article III provides that judges "shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour." The key interpretive question is whether "Office" refers to:

(a) **Specific position** (e.g., "Associate Justice of the Supreme Court"), or
(b) **Judicial office generally** (i.e., status as an Article III judge)

If interpretation (a) is correct, transitioning a justice from active service to Senior Justice status might constitute removal from "Office" in violation of Article III.

If interpretation (b) is correct, the transition preserves the constitutionally required tenure because the justice retains Article III judicial office -- merely in a different service capacity.

Several textual and structural arguments support interpretation (b):

**Article III refers to "Judges" not positions.** The tenure clause protects "Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts" -- referring to persons, not positions. A judge who retains judicial status and powers has not been removed from office merely because their service capacity changed.

**Senior status precedent.** For over a century, Article III judges have taken "senior status" under 28 U.S.C. Section 371, reducing their caseload while retaining full Article III protections. No court has held that senior status violates tenure protections. The Act's Senior Justice provisions extend this established mechanism.

**Compensation clause parallel.** Article III protects both tenure and compensation. The compensation clause prohibits diminishment "during their Continuance in Office." If transitioning to Senior Justice status ended "Office," the compensation protection would terminate -- yet senior judges continue receiving full salary, and no one argues this is constitutionally gratuitous. The consistent interpretation is that "Office" persists through senior status.

**Functional judicial power.** Justices in Senior Justice status retain full judicial powers: they may hear cases, sit on circuit courts by designation, participate in panels and commissions, and exercise all Article III judicial functions when assigned. They remain federal judges in every meaningful sense.

### Scholarly Framework: Duty vs. Tenure

Constitutional scholar Akhil Reed Amar has articulated a framework directly relevant to the Act's three-phase career structure. Amar argues that Congress may regulate judicial *duties* without violating constitutional *tenure* protections. The distinction is critical: Article III protects judges from removal during "good behaviour," but this protection attaches to their *office*, not to any particular *assignment of duties* within that office.

Under this framework, transitioning a justice from active Supreme Court service to Senior Justice status does not touch tenure -- the justice continues to hold Article III office, with all attendant constitutional protections, indefinitely. What changes is the duty assignment: the justice no longer sits regularly on the Supreme Court but remains available for judicial service in other capacities. Congress has uncontested authority to structure how judicial duties are assigned, exercised through the Necessary and Proper Clause in service of Article III's vesting of judicial power.

Amar's proposal for eighteen-year active service terms relies on this same constitutional foundation. The Act's twelve-year term operates under identical logic -- the specific duration does not alter the constitutional analysis. Whether twelve years or eighteen, the mechanism preserves life tenure while regularizing duty assignments.

This scholarly framework reinforces the textual arguments above. The "good behaviour" clause protects against removal from judicial office for political reasons. It does not guarantee any particular caseload assignment, duty station, or service status. A justice in Senior Justice status has not been removed -- they have been reassigned within their continuing judicial office.

### Precedent: Senior Status for Article III Judges

The strongest support for the Act's Senior Justice mechanism is the longstanding practice of senior status for lower court judges.

**28 U.S.C. Section 371** permits Article III judges meeting age and service requirements to take senior status. Senior judges:

- Retain life tenure and full salary
- May continue hearing cases at reduced volume
- Maintain Article III protections
- Create vacancies for new judicial appointments

This system has operated since 1919 without successful constitutional challenge. Hundreds of Article III judges have taken senior status. The federal judiciary depends on senior judges for substantial case processing capacity.

The Act's Senior Justice provisions explicitly build on this precedent (Section 402(c)). The mechanism is functionally identical: judges transition from active to senior status, retain Article III protections, may continue hearing cases, and create vacancies for presidential appointment.

The novel element is applying this mechanism to Supreme Court justices and making transition mandatory after twelve years rather than voluntary upon meeting age/service requirements. Neither distinction should alter the constitutional analysis:

**Supreme Court application.** Article III's tenure protection applies equally to "Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts." If senior status preserves tenure for circuit and district judges, it preserves tenure for Supreme Court justices. The constitutional text draws no distinction.

**Mandatory vs. voluntary transition.** The constitutional question is whether the justice retains "Office" -- not whether they chose the transition. A justice in Senior Justice status holds the same Article III status regardless of whether transition was voluntary or scheduled. The "good behavior" tenure protection is satisfied either way.

### Counterargument: Constructive Removal

Critics may argue that mandatory transition to Senior Justice status constitutes "constructive removal" from the Supreme Court, violating Article III's "good behavior" protection.

This argument faces several difficulties:

**No removal occurs.** The justice retains judicial office, salary, tenure, and powers. They are not removed from the federal judiciary -- only from active Supreme Court caseload assignment. Reassignment of duties within continued judicial office is not removal.

**Duty regulation, not tenure termination.** As constitutional scholar Akhil Reed Amar has argued, the proper analytical distinction is between regulating judicial *duties* (constitutionally permissible) and terminating judicial *tenure* (constitutionally prohibited). The Senior Justice transition regulates when justices perform Supreme Court duties; it does not terminate their Article III tenure. The justice retains office, salary, and judicial power -- only the duty assignment changes.

**Congress controls jurisdiction.** Article III gives Congress broad authority over federal court jurisdiction. Congress has repeatedly modified Supreme Court jurisdiction, mandatory vs. discretionary review, and case assignment procedures. Determining which justices hear which cases falls within congressional authority over judicial administration.

**Senior status parallel.** If mandatory Senior Justice transition constitutes removal, voluntary senior status should as well -- yet no one argues that 28 U.S.C. Section 371 violates Article III. The constitutional status of the resulting senior status should not depend on whether the trigger was temporal (twelve years) or personal choice.

**Functional test.** If "good behavior" tenure means anything, it means a judge cannot be removed for decisions that displease the political branches. The Act's scheduled transition applies neutrally based on time served, not case outcomes. No justice is targeted for removal based on decisions.

### Risk Assessment

The three-phase career structure presents the highest litigation risk among the Act's provisions. It has not been directly tested at the Supreme Court level, and a court inclined to strike the provision could adopt the "constructive removal" theory.

However, the textual arguments, Amar's scholarly framework distinguishing duty regulation from tenure termination, precedential support from 28 U.S.C. Section 371, and century-long practice of senior status for Article III judges provide strong foundation for constitutionality. The more natural reading of Article III is that "Office" refers to judicial status generally, which Senior Justice status preserves.

## Chief Justice Rotation

### Constitutional Framework

The Act establishes automatic Chief Justice rotation: the most senior Associate Justice who has not previously served as Chief Justice becomes Chief Justice upon commencing their eleventh year of active service, serving for two years before transitioning to Senior Justice status. This rotation requires no separate nomination or confirmation.

The constitutional question is whether Congress may structure the Chief Justice position this way without presidential nomination and Senate confirmation for each transition.

### The Chief Justice as Duty Assignment

The Constitution mentions the Chief Justice only once -- in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6: "When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside." This sole constitutional function (presiding over presidential impeachment trials) does not require a separately appointed officer; it requires only that someone hold the designation "Chief Justice" when such a trial occurs.

The Constitution does not specify how the Chief Justice is selected. It does not require separate nomination and confirmation for the Chief Justice position. It does not even clearly establish that "Chief Justice" is a distinct office rather than a designation among Supreme Court justices.

Constitutional scholars have noted this ambiguity. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, in analyzing Supreme Court term limits, observed that "the Constitution does not clearly indicate whether the position of chief justice is a distinct office" and that "the overwhelming similarity between the justices might suggest that the chief is merely first among equals." The Constitution "makes no separate provision for appointment as chief and mentions only 'judges of the Supreme Court' when describing the presidential appointment power."

Under this reading, "Chief Justice" is a duty assignment -- designating which justice performs certain administrative and ceremonial functions -- rather than a separate Article III office requiring independent appointment. Congress has broad authority to regulate judicial duties, including determining how the Chief Justice designation rotates among sitting justices.

### Historical Practice Supports Congressional Authority

The current practice of separate Chief Justice nomination and confirmation is statutory and customary, not constitutionally mandated. Congress established the position in the Judiciary Act of 1789 and has regulated its duties ever since. The administrative functions now associated with the Chief Justice -- chairing the Judicial Conference, appointing judges to specialized courts, serving as administrative head of the federal judiciary -- are statutory creations that Congress could restructure.

The Act's automatic rotation treats the Chief Justice position as what the Constitution suggests it is: a designation among equal Article III justices, not a separate constitutional office. The rotation ensures every justice who completes a full term serves as Chief Justice -- democratizing an honor that currently depends on actuarial chance and presidential preference.

### Appointment Clause Analysis

Critics might argue that the Appointments Clause (Article II, Section 2) requires presidential nomination and Senate confirmation for the Chief Justice. This argument faces significant difficulties:

**The justice is already appointed.** Under the Act's rotation, the person becoming Chief Justice has already been nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and appointed as an Article III justice. The Appointments Clause has been satisfied. Rotating the Chief Justice designation among already-appointed justices does not require a new appointment -- it reassigns duties within existing appointments.

**Duty assignments are not appointments.** When a circuit court chief judge assumes that position by seniority (as occurs under 28 U.S.C. Section 45), no new appointment occurs. The judge was already appointed; the chief designation follows automatically. The Act applies the same logic to the Supreme Court.

**Constitutional text supports duty-assignment reading.** The Constitution refers to "Judges of the supreme Court" and "the chief Justice" without suggesting the latter is a separate appointment. The natural reading is that the Chief Justice is one of the judges, not a distinct officer.

### Risk Assessment

The automatic Chief Justice rotation presents minimal additional litigation risk beyond the three-phase career structure provisions. If courts accept that Congress may regulate judicial duties without touching tenure -- the framework supporting the Senior Justice transition -- then rotating the Chief Justice designation among sitting justices follows directly. The Chief Justice rotation is a less aggressive exercise of congressional power than mandatory Senior Justice transition, because it changes only which justice performs certain administrative duties, not whether they remain active Supreme Court members.

The strongest argument against automatic rotation is historical practice: separate Chief Justice nominations and confirmations have occurred since 1789. However, historical practice does not establish constitutional requirement. Congress has authority to restructure positions it created by statute, and the Appointments Clause is satisfied when the justice is initially appointed to the Court.

## Qualification Requirements

### Constitutional Silence

The Constitution specifies no qualifications for federal judges. Unlike Article I (age, citizenship, and residency requirements for Congress) and Article II (natural-born citizenship, age, and residency for the presidency), Article III is silent on judicial qualifications.

This silence creates interpretive ambiguity: Does it mean Congress cannot impose qualifications (negative implication), or that Congress has discretion to do so (permissive silence)?

### Arguments for Congressional Authority

**Necessary and Proper Clause.** Congress may enact laws "necessary and proper" for carrying out constitutional functions, including the judicial power. Ensuring minimally qualified judges serves the effective administration of justice.

**Historical practice.** Congress has imposed de facto qualifications through advice-and-consent practice, ABA review processes, and informal norms. The Act codifies expectations that have long operated informally.

**Structural qualifications.** The Act's requirement of five years' federal appellate service effectively requires prior Senate confirmation as an Article III judge. This is a structural qualification (prior exercise of appointment power) rather than a personal characteristic.

**No constitutional prohibition.** The Constitution does not prohibit congressional qualification standards. Negative implications from Article I and II qualification clauses are weak -- those provisions establish who is eligible, not necessarily exclusive eligibility criteria.

### Arguments Against Congressional Authority

**Appointments Clause.** Article II vests appointment power in the President with Senate advice and consent. Congressional qualification requirements arguably intrude on executive appointment discretion.

**Structural inference.** The Constitution's specification of qualifications for Congress and the presidency, combined with silence for judges, may imply intentional absence of judicial qualifications. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius -- expression of one thing excludes others.

**Separation of powers.** Allowing Congress to set judicial qualifications could enable Congress to shape the judiciary by manipulating eligibility criteria.

### Risk Assessment

The Act's qualification requirements face moderate litigation risk. The constitutional question is genuinely unsettled.

However, several features of the Act's specific requirements reduce vulnerability:

**Minimal threshold.** The requirements (fifteen years legal experience, five years federal appellate service) establish a floor, not extensive criteria. They ensure basic competence without constraining presidential choice among hundreds of qualified candidates.

**Professional, not political.** The requirements are professional qualifications (experience, judicial service) not political criteria (ideology, party affiliation). They cannot be manipulated to exclude candidates based on viewpoint.

**Prior confirmation requirement.** Requiring federal appellate service means every Supreme Court nominee will have previously undergone Senate confirmation as an Article III judge. This leverages the existing appointment process rather than creating new barriers.

**Severability.** If qualification requirements are struck down, the remainder of the Act continues in effect. The Act's core provisions (circuit reorganization, Court composition alignment, three-phase career structure) do not depend on Title III qualifications.

---

## Circuit Reorganization

### Constitutional Basis

Congressional authority to organize inferior federal courts is explicit in Article III: Congress may "from time to time ordain and establish" courts below the Supreme Court. This authority necessarily includes defining court jurisdictions and boundaries.

Congress has reorganized circuit boundaries repeatedly throughout American history. The current circuit structure is entirely statutory. No constitutional provision mandates particular circuit configurations.

### Population-Based Boundaries

The Act's innovation is organizing circuits primarily by population rather than state groupings. This approach serves equal protection values (equal access to federal justice) and administrative efficiency (balanced workloads).

Nothing in Article III requires circuits to follow state boundaries. The original circuits grouped states for convenience; the Act groups populations for equity. Both are permissible exercises of congressional authority.

### Decennial Rebalancing

The Act provides for circuit boundary adjustments following each census to maintain population equality. This ongoing adjustment mechanism is consistent with Article III's "from time to time" language, which contemplates continuing congressional authority over judicial organization.

### Risk Assessment

Circuit reorganization provisions face minimal litigation risk. Congressional authority is clear, historical practice is extensive, and no constitutional provision constrains circuit design. Challenges would need to identify a constitutional violation where none is apparent.

---

## Anticipated Challenges

### Standing and Justiciability

Before reaching merits, courts must determine whether plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Act and whether claims present justiciable controversies.

**Congressional standing.** Individual members of Congress likely lack standing to challenge the Act absent concrete injury. Raines v. Byrd (1997) held that legislators claiming institutional injury from allegedly unconstitutional statutes generally lack standing.

**Judicial standing.** Sitting justices affected by the three-phase career structure might claim injury. However, federal judges challenging statutes affecting the judiciary raise separation of powers concerns about judicial self-dealing.

**Third-party standing.** Litigants affected by decisions of the expanded or reorganized courts might claim injury. Courts have generally been skeptical of such derivative claims.

**Political question.** Some aspects of judicial organization may present nonjusticiable political questions committed to congressional discretion. However, claims that the Act violates specific constitutional provisions (Article III tenure) would likely be justiciable.

### Likely Litigation Theories

**Constructive removal claim.** Challengers would argue that mandatory Senior Justice transition removes justices from "Office" in violation of Article III tenure protection. This is the strongest potential claim, discussed extensively above.

**Appointments Clause claim.** Challengers might argue that qualification requirements or automatic Chief Justice rotation unconstitutionally constrain presidential appointment power. This claim has some textual basis but faces significant counterarguments -- particularly for Chief Justice rotation, where the justice has already been appointed through the constitutional process.

**Separation of powers claim.** Challengers might argue that the Act's combination of provisions impermissibly restructures the judicial branch. This claim would need to identify specific constitutional violations rather than generalized separation of powers concerns.

**Equal protection claim.** Challengers might argue that population-based circuits treat litigants differently based on geography. This claim is weak -- the Act's purpose is to equalize access to justice, and geographic distinctions in federal court organization are longstanding.

### Venue and Timing

Challenges to the Act would likely be filed in district court and proceed through the appellate process -- ultimately reaching the Supreme Court whose composition the Act affects.

This creates an awkward dynamic: justices would rule on a statute directly affecting their tenure and the Court's structure. Recusal questions would arise. The Court might seek to avoid the merits through standing, ripeness, or political question doctrines.

If challenges succeed at lower court levels, the Act's severability clause (Section 403(c)) ensures that valid provisions remain in effect even if specific provisions are struck.

---

## Severability Analysis

The Act includes an explicit severability clause: "If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in effect." (Section 403(c))

This clause is significant because the Act's major components -- circuit reorganization, Court composition alignment, three-phase career structure, Chief Justice rotation, and qualification requirements -- can function independently:

**If three-phase career structure provisions are struck:** Court composition alignment could proceed without the regular replacement schedule. The expanded Court would operate like the current Court, with vacancies arising from death or voluntary retirement rather than scheduled transition. Chief Justice rotation would also fail, as it depends on the twelve-year active service framework.

**If Chief Justice rotation is struck:** The three-phase career structure and Court composition alignment provisions would operate with modification. The Chief Justice would be appointed through traditional nomination and confirmation during the transition period and thereafter as Senior Justice transitions create vacancies.

**If qualification requirements are struck:** Court composition alignment, three-phase career structure, and Chief Justice rotation provisions would operate unchanged. The appointment process would continue without statutory qualification floor.

**If Court composition alignment is limited:** Circuit reorganization would proceed independently. The circuit-aligned rationale for the composition would weaken, but population-based circuits serve independent purposes of workload balance and equal representation.

**If circuit reorganization is struck:** This is unlikely given clear congressional authority over inferior courts. But if struck, Court composition alignment and three-phase career structure provisions would proceed under alternative rationales.

The modular structure reduces the Act's vulnerability to total invalidation. Even successful challenges to specific provisions would leave substantial reforms in effect.

---

## Conclusion

The Act operates within Congress's established constitutional authority to organize the federal judiciary. The strongest legal foundation supports circuit reorganization (explicit Article III authority, extensive historical practice) and Court composition alignment (seven historical precedents, no constitutional specification of Court size). Chief Justice rotation presents minimal additional risk because it regulates duty assignments among already-appointed justices rather than requiring new appointments. Qualification requirements face moderate uncertainty but are defensible under the Necessary and Proper Clause and survive severability analysis if struck.

The three-phase career structure presents the most significant legal question. While strong textual arguments, Akhil Reed Amar's scholarly framework distinguishing duty regulation from tenure termination, and the precedent of 28 U.S.C. Section 371 support constitutionality, the provision applies a familiar mechanism (senior status) in a novel context (mandatory Supreme Court transition). A challenge reaching the merits would present a question of first impression.

The Act's designers should anticipate litigation and prepare for the possibility that specific provisions -- particularly the three-phase career structure or qualification requirements -- might be struck while core structural reforms survive. The severability clause and modular design ensure that successful challenges to individual provisions do not collapse the entire reform architecture.

The ultimate constitutional assessment will depend on how courts balance textual analysis, historical practice, structural inference, and practical consequences. The Act's proponents have credible constitutional arguments; its opponents have colorable challenges. The question may ultimately be resolved through political and judicial processes operating together, as occurred with previous major judicial reorganizations throughout American history.
