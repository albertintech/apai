## Problem Statement

The federal judiciary operates under a structure designed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that no longer serves constitutional principles of equal representation and balanced power. Four interconnected dysfunctions undermine public confidence and judicial effectiveness.

**Population imbalance across circuits.** The current thirteen federal circuits reflect historical state groupings rather than contemporary population distribution. The Ninth Circuit serves over 68 million people across nine states and two territories; the First Circuit serves under 14 million across six states and territories. This nearly five-to-one disparity creates unequal workloads, inconsistent case processing times, and fundamentally unequal access to federal justice depending on where litigants happen to reside. As population continues shifting toward the Sun Belt and away from the Northeast, these disparities will only worsen.

**Arbitrary appointment opportunities.** Supreme Court vacancies depend entirely on when sitting justices die or choose to retire -- factors bearing no relationship to constitutional design or democratic mandate. President Carter appointed zero justices during his term; President Trump appointed three in four years. This actuarial randomness means that some presidents shape constitutional interpretation for generations while others leave no mark on the Court at all. The resulting incentives encourage strategic retirement timing, discourage justices from stepping down during administrations of the opposing party, and concentrate enormous power based on luck rather than legitimate democratic processes.

**National anxiety over justice health and longevity.** The current system creates a perverse dynamic where the nation holds its breath every time an aging justice shows signs of decline. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's final years illustrated this vividly -- her health became a matter of intense national anxiety, her every hospital visit triggered speculation about the Court's future, and her death precipitated a constitutional crisis. This is not a dignified way to treat distinguished jurists who have devoted their careers to public service, and it is not a healthy dynamic for the republic. The current system forces impossible choices on aging justices: retire strategically to benefit their preferred party, or cling to office hoping to outlast an unfavorable administration.

**Erosion of confirmation norms.** The judicial appointment process has devolved from professional evaluation to partisan warfare. The Senate blocked consideration of the Garland nomination for nearly a year in 2016, then confirmed the Barrett nomination in weeks during 2020. Qualification standards have weakened as ideological alignment increasingly trumps professional credentials. The confirmation process provides no structural guarantee that the Senate will act on nominations, that nominees will meet minimum professional standards, or that the public will receive meaningful information about judicial philosophy before lifetime appointments are made.

These are not partisan complaints about specific outcomes. They are structural failures that would concern any observer regardless of which party benefits at any given moment. The current system depends on norms of restraint and good faith that have collapsed under partisan pressure. Structural reform is necessary because informal constraints have proven inadequate.

## Solution Architecture

The Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA), hereafter "the Act," addresses these dysfunctions through five integrated structural mechanisms rather than relying on norms, restraint, or good intentions.

**Population-based circuit organization** replaces historical boundaries with mathematical formula. Fifteen regional circuits serve approximately equal populations, with boundaries rebalanced following each decennial census. This ensures equal representation and balanced workloads regardless of where populations migrate over time. The structure eliminates the current disparities automatically -- no future legislation required as demographics shift.

**Circuit-aligned Court composition** ties Supreme Court size to administrative structure rather than political convenience. Fifteen justice positions correspond to fifteen regional circuits, restoring the historical relationship between circuit organization and Court membership that existed when six justices served six circuits and nine justices served nine circuits. Each justice serves as circuit justice for an assigned regional circuit. This provides a principled basis for Court size that transcends immediate partisan calculations and forecloses endless expansion.

**Three-phase career structure** removes the nation's constitutional future from dependence on individual justices' health and longevity. Each justice progresses through three distinct phases: Associate Justice for years one through ten, Chief Justice for years eleven and twelve, and Senior Justice thereafter. These are phases within a single justice position, not separate offices. At steady state, the Court has fifteen justices in active service -- fourteen in the Associate Justice phase and one in the Chief Justice phase. This structure provides clarity and predictability -- every justice knows exactly what their career arc will look like, eliminating strategic retirement calculations and the morbid national anxiety that accompanies aging justices under the current system. Senior Justices retain full Article III protections, life tenure, and full compensation while serving in a reduced-duty capacity.

**Automatic Chief Justice rotation** diffuses the concentration of power that currently resides in the Chief Justice position. Rather than a single individual serving as Chief Justice for decades based on presidential selection and actuarial chance, the position rotates automatically among justices based on seniority. Each justice serves as Chief Justice for their final two years of active service before transitioning to Senior Justice status. The Chief Justice additionally provides circuit justice coverage for the D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit. Every justice who completes a full term serves as Chief Justice -- democratizing an honor and responsibility that the current system distributes arbitrarily.

**Structural qualification and transparency requirements** replace informal expectations with enforceable standards. Minimum professional qualifications ensure nominees have substantial judicial records. Mandatory documentation requirements shift confirmation from theatrical questioning to substantive credential evaluation. Timeline requirements guarantee Senate action rather than indefinite obstruction.

These mechanisms work together as a coherent system. Circuit reorganization provides the principled basis for Court composition. Court composition creates the framework for the predictable appointment schedule. The appointment schedule enables the three-phase career structure. Automatic Chief Justice rotation ensures every justice shares in leading the Court. Qualification requirements ensure the expanded appointment process produces competent judges. Each component reinforces the others.

## Title-by-Title Summary

**Title I: Federal Circuit Reorganization** establishes fifteen population-based regional circuits replacing the current geographic arrangement. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts draws boundaries within 180 days of enactment, ensuring no circuit serves more than 110% or less than 90% of the average circuit population. Boundaries rebalance automatically following each decennial census. Existing circuit judges are reassigned based on primary residence. The District of Columbia Circuit and Federal Circuit retain their specialized jurisdictions unchanged, preserving established expertise in administrative law and patent matters. Each regional circuit maintains at least six active judges.

**Title II: Supreme Court Composition and Appointments** aligns the Court with circuit organization through fifteen justice positions, each corresponding to one regional circuit. Each justice progresses through a three-phase career structure: Associate Justice for years one through ten (hearing and deciding cases), Chief Justice for years eleven and twelve (leading the Court and federal judiciary), and Senior Justice thereafter (reduced-duty status with full Article III protections). At steady state, the Court has fifteen justices in active service -- fourteen in the Associate Justice phase and one in the Chief Justice phase. Each justice serves as circuit justice for an assigned regional circuit; the Chief Justice additionally covers the D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit. The Chief Justice position rotates automatically by seniority -- the most senior Associate Justice who has not previously served as Chief Justice assumes the role upon commencing their eleventh year of active service. No separate nomination or confirmation is required. Senior Justices retain full constitutional protections, salary, benefits, and life tenure. They may continue hearing cases by Chief Justice assignment, sit on circuit courts by designation, or decline assignments without penalty. Expansion proceeds gradually during the transition period -- one additional justice appointed each odd-numbered year until all fifteen positions are filled. Once fully implemented, every presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities.

**Title III: Qualifications and Transparency** establishes minimum requirements for Supreme Court service: citizenship for at least ten years, an accredited law degree, good standing bar admission, at least fifteen years of legal experience, and at least five years as a federal appellate judge. The federal appellate requirement ensures every nominee has an extensive written record of judicial opinions for evaluation. Nominees must provide comprehensive documentation -- professional biography, personal background statement, and judicial philosophy statement -- all publicly disclosed at least thirty days before confirmation hearings. A five-member judicial qualifications panel reviews each nominee. The Senate must complete consideration within 120 days.

**Title IV: Implementation and Fairness Provisions** phases the reforms across multiple years. Circuit reorganization takes effect on the first January 1 at least twenty-four months after enactment, allowing adequate preparation time. Court expansion begins in the first odd-numbered year at least eighteen months after enactment. Automatic Chief Justice rotation begins when the first justice appointed under the expansion schedule reaches their eleventh year of active service. The regular replacement schedule begins twelve years after the first expansion appointment, when the first justice appointed under the Act transitions from Chief Justice to Senior Justice. Constitutional protections are explicitly preserved: no sitting justice is removed from office, no judicial salary is reduced, and "good behavior" tenure remains fully intact. Justices serving on the effective date may continue in active service or voluntarily elect Senior Justice status. Severability provisions ensure partial implementation if any provision faces successful legal challenge.

## Implementation Overview

The Act unfolds across three phases spanning approximately fifteen years from enactment to steady-state operation.

**Phase One (Years 1-2): Circuit Reorganization.** The Administrative Office develops population-based circuit boundaries. States and courts prepare for transition. New circuit structure takes effect approximately two years after enactment. Existing judges are reassigned; additional circuit judges are appointed as needed.

**Phase Two (Years 2-12): Court Expansion.** Beginning in the first odd-numbered year at least eighteen months after enactment, the President nominates one additional Supreme Court justice. This continues each odd-numbered year until all fifteen justice positions are filled -- approximately six expansion appointments total. During this transition, multiple administrations participate in shaping the expanded Court.

**Phase Three (Year 11+): Three-Phase Career Structure and Regular Replacement.** Eleven years after the first expansion appointment, automatic Chief Justice rotation begins when the first justice appointed under the expansion schedule reaches their eleventh year of active service. Twelve years after the first expansion appointment, the regular replacement cycle begins: that justice completes their two-year term as Chief Justice and transitions to Senior Justice status, creating a vacancy. From that point forward, each odd-numbered year brings a predictable transition -- one justice moves from Associate Justice to Chief Justice, and the outgoing Chief Justice transitions to Senior Justice. The system reaches equilibrium: two appointments per presidential term, every justice serving as Chief Justice, and constitutional outcomes no longer dependent on individual health and longevity.

This phased approach serves multiple purposes. It spreads expansion appointments across multiple administrations, preventing any single president from dominating the transition. It allows the judicial system time to absorb changes incrementally. It demonstrates the reform's operation before reaching full implementation, building legitimacy through successful execution.

## Conclusion

The Act represents structural judicial reform rather than ideological court-packing. The distinction matters. Court-packing -- adding seats to change immediate outcomes -- triggers an arms race with no stopping principle and destroys institutional legitimacy. The Act ties Court size to circuit organization, phases expansion across multiple administrations, creates a regular replacement schedule that treats all future presidents equally regardless of party, and diffuses the power of the Chief Justice position through automatic rotation.

The reform addresses genuine structural problems: population imbalance across circuits, arbitrary appointment opportunities based on actuarial chance, national anxiety over justice health and longevity, concentration of power in a single Chief Justice for decades, and the collapse of confirmation norms. It does so through mechanisms that work regardless of which party holds power at any given moment.

The Act does not predetermine judicial outcomes, mandate particular judicial philosophies, or remove any sitting justice. It creates conditions for a well-functioning judiciary -- equal representation, predictable appointments, a dignified career structure, diffused leadership, qualified judges, transparent processes -- without dictating what that judiciary should decide.
