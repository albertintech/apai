# ⚖️ Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA)

A structural reform to modernize the federal judiciary through population-based circuits, Supreme Court composition aligned with circuit organization, a three-phase career structure for justices, and automatic Chief Justice rotation.

## Overview

FJBAA addresses fundamental dysfunctions in the federal judiciary: circuit boundaries reflecting nineteenth-century geography rather than contemporary population, arbitrary appointment opportunities based on actuarial chance, national anxiety over justice health and longevity, concentration of power in a single Chief Justice for decades, and eroded confirmation norms. The Act replaces norm-dependent processes with structural mechanisms that function regardless of partisan conditions.

## Key Components

- **⚖️ Title I: Federal Circuit Reorganization** — Fifteen population-based regional circuits with decennial rebalancing ensuring equal representation.

- **🏛️ Title II: Supreme Court Composition** — Fifteen Associate Justices plus Chief Justice aligned with circuit structure; three-phase career structure (Associate Justice years 1-10, Chief Justice years 11-12, Senior Justice thereafter); automatic Chief Justice rotation by seniority.

- **📋 Title III: Qualifications and Transparency** — Minimum professional requirements, mandatory documentation, and 120-day Senate consideration timeline.

- **📅 Title IV: Implementation** — Phased rollout preserving all constitutional protections; no sitting justice removed; two appointments per presidential term once operational.

## Status

Rev 1.3 — Active development
