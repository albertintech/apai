## Problem Statement

The federal judiciary operates under a structure designed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that no longer serves constitutional principles of equal representation and balanced power. Five interconnected dysfunctions undermine public confidence and judicial effectiveness.

**Population imbalance across circuits.** The current thirteen federal circuits reflect historical state groupings rather than contemporary population distribution. The Ninth Circuit serves over 68 million people across nine states and two territories; the First Circuit serves under 14 million across six states and territories. This nearly five-to-one disparity creates unequal workloads, inconsistent case processing times, and fundamentally unequal access to federal justice depending on where litigants happen to reside. As population continues shifting toward the Sun Belt and away from the Northeast, these disparities will only worsen.

**Arbitrary appointment opportunities.** Supreme Court vacancies depend entirely on when sitting justices die or choose to retire -- factors bearing no relationship to constitutional design or democratic mandate. President Carter appointed zero justices during his term; President Trump appointed three in four years. This actuarial randomness means that some presidents shape constitutional interpretation for generations while others leave no mark on the Court at all. The resulting incentives encourage strategic retirement timing, discourage justices from stepping down during administrations of the opposing party, and concentrate enormous power based on luck rather than legitimate democratic processes.

**National anxiety over justice health and longevity.** The current system creates a perverse dynamic where the nation holds its breath every time an aging justice shows signs of decline. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's final years illustrated this vividly -- her health became a matter of intense national anxiety, her every hospital visit triggered speculation about the Court's future, and her death precipitated a constitutional crisis. This is not a dignified way to treat distinguished jurists who have devoted their careers to public service, and it is not a healthy dynamic for the republic. The current system forces impossible choices on aging justices: retire strategically to benefit their preferred party, or cling to office hoping to outlast an unfavorable administration.

**Erosion of confirmation norms.** The judicial appointment process has devolved from professional evaluation to partisan warfare. The Senate blocked consideration of the Garland nomination for nearly a year in 2016, then confirmed the Barrett nomination in weeks during 2020. Qualification standards have weakened as ideological alignment increasingly trumps professional credentials. The confirmation process provides no structural guarantee that the Senate will act on nominations, that nominees will meet minimum professional standards, or that the public will receive meaningful information about judicial philosophy before lifetime appointments are made.

**Absence of enforceable ethical standards.** The Supreme Court is the only court in the federal system that operates without binding ethical rules and without any mechanism for investigating or sanctioning ethical violations. Lower federal judges are bound by the Code of Conduct for United States Judges and subject to discipline under the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act. Supreme Court justices are bound by neither. The Court's November 2023 adoption of a voluntary ethics code was a response to public pressure but lacks any enforcement mechanism -- justices decide for themselves whether they have violated the code and what, if anything, to do about it. Ongoing controversies over undisclosed gifts, travel, real estate transactions, and relationships with parties who have business before the Court demonstrate that this self-policing model has failed to maintain public confidence.

These are not partisan complaints about specific outcomes. They are structural failures that would concern any observer regardless of which party benefits at any given moment. The current system depends on norms of restraint and good faith that have collapsed under partisan pressure. Structural reform is necessary because informal constraints have proven inadequate.

## Solution Architecture

The Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA), hereafter "the Act," addresses these dysfunctions through six integrated structural mechanisms rather than relying on norms, restraint, or good intentions.

**Population-based circuit organization** replaces historical boundaries with mathematical formula. Fifteen regional circuits serve approximately equal populations, with boundaries rebalanced following each decennial census. This ensures equal representation and balanced workloads regardless of where populations migrate over time. The structure eliminates the current disparities automatically -- no future legislation required as demographics shift.

**Circuit-aligned Court composition** ties Supreme Court size to administrative structure rather than political convenience. Fifteen Associate Justices correspond to fifteen regional circuits, restoring the historical relationship between circuit organization and Court membership that existed when six justices served six circuits and nine justices served nine circuits. This provides a principled basis for Court size that transcends immediate partisan calculations and forecloses endless expansion.

**Three-phase career structure** removes the nation's constitutional future from dependence on individual justices' health and longevity. Each justice progresses through three distinct phases: Associate Justice for years one through ten, Chief Justice for years eleven and twelve, and Senior Justice thereafter. This structure provides clarity and predictability -- every justice knows exactly what their career arc will look like, eliminating strategic retirement calculations and the morbid national anxiety that accompanies aging justices under the current system. Senior Justices retain full Article III protections, life tenure, and full compensation while serving in a reduced-duty capacity.

**Automatic Chief Justice rotation** diffuses the concentration of power that currently resides in the Chief Justice position. Rather than a single individual serving as Chief Justice for decades based on presidential selection and actuarial chance, the position rotates automatically among justices based on seniority. Each justice serves as Chief Justice for their final two years of active service before transitioning to Senior Justice status. Every justice who completes a full term serves as Chief Justice -- democratizing an honor and responsibility that the current system distributes arbitrarily.

**Structural qualification and transparency requirements** replace informal expectations with enforceable standards. Minimum professional qualifications ensure nominees have substantial judicial records. Mandatory documentation requirements shift confirmation from theatrical questioning to substantive credential evaluation. Timeline requirements guarantee Senate action rather than indefinite obstruction.

**Binding ethics enforcement** replaces self-policing with structural accountability. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges becomes mandatory for Supreme Court justices. An Ethics Review Panel composed of Senior Justices adjudicates complaints, with an independent Judicial Inspector General conducting investigations. A graduated menu of sanctions -- from private admonition to mandatory early transition to Senior Justice status -- provides proportionate responses to ethical violations. Due process protections and supermajority requirements for serious sanctions prevent weaponization while ensuring meaningful accountability.

These mechanisms work together as a coherent system. Circuit reorganization provides the principled basis for Court expansion. Court expansion enables the predictable appointment schedule. The appointment schedule creates the framework for the three-phase career structure. Automatic Chief Justice rotation ensures every justice shares in leading the Court. Qualification requirements ensure the expanded appointment process produces competent judges. Ethics enforcement ensures that justices who violate binding standards face meaningful consequences. Each component reinforces the others.

## Title-by-Title Summary

**Title I: Federal Circuit Reorganization** establishes fifteen population-based regional circuits replacing the current geographic arrangement. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts draws boundaries within 180 days of enactment, ensuring no circuit serves more than 110% or less than 90% of the average circuit population. Boundaries rebalance automatically following each decennial census. Existing circuit judges are reassigned based on primary residence. The District of Columbia Circuit and Federal Circuit retain their specialized jurisdictions unchanged, preserving established expertise in administrative law and patent matters. Each regional circuit maintains at least six active judges.

**Title II: Supreme Court Composition and Appointments** aligns the Court with circuit organization through fifteen justice positions progressing through a three-phase career structure. Expansion proceeds gradually -- one additional justice appointed each odd-numbered year during the transition period. The Act establishes the three career phases: Associate Justice for years one through ten (hearing and deciding cases), Chief Justice for years eleven and twelve (leading the Court and federal judiciary), and Senior Justice thereafter (reduced-duty status with full Article III protections). The Chief Justice position rotates automatically by seniority -- the most senior Associate Justice who has not previously served as Chief Justice assumes the role upon commencing their eleventh year of active service. No separate nomination or confirmation is required. Senior Justices retain full constitutional protections, salary, benefits, and life tenure. They may continue hearing cases by Chief Justice assignment, sit on circuit courts by designation, serve on the Ethics Review Panel, or decline assignments without penalty. Once fully implemented, every presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities.

**Title III: Qualifications and Transparency** establishes minimum requirements for Supreme Court service: citizenship for at least ten years, an accredited law degree, good standing bar admission, at least fifteen years of legal experience, and at least five years as a federal appellate judge. The federal appellate requirement ensures every nominee has an extensive written record of judicial opinions for evaluation. Nominees must provide comprehensive documentation -- professional biography, personal background statement, and judicial philosophy statement -- all publicly disclosed at least thirty days before confirmation hearings. A five-member judicial qualifications panel reviews each nominee. The Senate must complete consideration within 120 days.

**Title IV: Implementation and Fairness Provisions** phases the reforms across multiple years. Circuit reorganization takes effect on the first January 1 at least twenty-four months after enactment, allowing adequate preparation time. Court expansion begins in the first odd-numbered year at least eighteen months after enactment. Automatic Chief Justice rotation begins when the first justice appointed under the expansion schedule reaches their eleventh year of active service. The regular replacement schedule begins twelve years after the first expansion appointment, when the first justice appointed under the Act transitions from Chief Justice to Senior Justice. Constitutional protections are explicitly preserved: no sitting justice is removed from office, no judicial salary is reduced, and "good behavior" tenure remains fully intact. Justices serving on the effective date may continue in active service or voluntarily elect Senior Justice status. Severability provisions ensure partial implementation if any provision faces successful legal challenge.

**Title V: Judicial Ethics and Accountability** establishes binding ethical standards and enforcement for the Supreme Court. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges applies in its entirety to all justices, with compliance mandatory rather than advisory. Justices must provide written explanations for recusal decisions, published on the Court's website and compiled in annual reports to Congress.

An Ethics Review Panel of five Senior Justices adjudicates ethics complaints. During the transition period before sufficient Senior Justices are available, retired circuit chief judges selected by lottery serve on a Bridge Panel to ensure immediate capacity. The Panel may impose sanctions ranging from private admonition to public censure, mandatory recusal, administrative reassignment, mandatory early transition to Senior Justice status, and referral to the House for impeachment consideration. Serious sanctions require a four-of-five supermajority vote, preventing partisan weaponization.

A Judicial Inspector General -- selected by the Ethics Review Panel from candidates nominated by a committee including the Comptroller General, retired circuit judges, and the ABA president -- serves a ten-year non-renewable term and may be removed only for cause by unanimous Panel vote. The Inspector General receives complaints, conducts preliminary review and investigation, and reports findings to the Panel.

Comprehensive due process protections ensure fairness: written notice of allegations, access to evidence, right to counsel, opportunity to respond, hearing before the Panel, and written decisions with reasons. Complaints and investigations remain confidential until final determination. A justice subject to serious sanctions may appeal to the full body of Senior Justices (En Banc Senior Body), with automatic stay pending review.

Mandatory Early Transition -- the most serious sanction short of impeachment referral -- may be imposed only for enumerated objective violations: undisclosed financial interests above specified thresholds, participation in matters despite conflicts, ex parte contacts, intentional misrepresentation on disclosure forms, acceptance of substantial undisclosed benefits from parties likely to appear before the Court, and willful persistent violation after prior sanction. This enumeration prevents the sanction from being used to punish disfavored judicial philosophies.

Title V explicitly preserves congressional impeachment authority and Department of Justice criminal jurisdiction. The ethics framework supplements rather than supplants these constitutional mechanisms.

## Implementation Overview

The Act unfolds across three phases spanning approximately fifteen years from enactment to steady-state operation, with ethics infrastructure operational from Year One.

**Phase One (Years 1-2): Circuit Reorganization and Ethics Infrastructure.** The Administrative Office develops population-based circuit boundaries. States and courts prepare for transition. New circuit structure takes effect approximately two years after enactment. Existing judges are reassigned; additional circuit judges are appointed as needed. Simultaneously, the first Judicial Inspector General is appointed within one year. The Ethics Review Panel (supplemented by Bridge Panel as needed) adopts rules of procedure. The Code of Conduct becomes binding immediately, and complaint intake begins.

**Phase Two (Years 2-12): Court Expansion.** Beginning in the first odd-numbered year at least eighteen months after enactment, the President nominates one additional Supreme Court justice. This continues each odd-numbered year until the Court reaches fifteen Associate Justices -- approximately six expansion appointments total. During this transition, multiple administrations participate in shaping the expanded Court. Ethics enforcement operates throughout, with the Inspector General investigating complaints and the Ethics Review Panel adjudicating findings.

**Phase Three (Year 11+): Three-Phase Career Structure, Regular Replacement, and Ethics Maturation.** Eleven years after the first expansion appointment, automatic Chief Justice rotation begins when the first justice appointed under the expansion schedule reaches their eleventh year of active service. Twelve years after the first expansion appointment, the regular replacement cycle begins: that justice completes their two-year term as Chief Justice and transitions to Senior Justice status, creating a vacancy. From that point forward, each odd-numbered year brings a predictable transition -- one justice moves from Associate Justice to Chief Justice, and the outgoing Chief Justice transitions to Senior Justice. As expansion-appointed justices accumulate in Senior Justice status, the Ethics Review Panel transitions from Bridge Panel supplementation to full Senior Justice composition (approximately Year 21, when five expansion-appointed Senior Justices are available). The system reaches equilibrium: two appointments per presidential term, every justice serving as Chief Justice, constitutional outcomes no longer dependent on individual health and longevity, and robust ethics enforcement by peers of equal constitutional stature.

This phased approach serves multiple purposes. It spreads expansion appointments across multiple administrations, preventing any single president from dominating the transition. It allows the judicial system time to absorb changes incrementally. It demonstrates the reform's operation before reaching full implementation, building legitimacy through successful execution. And it ensures ethics enforcement capacity from Day One while allowing the enforcement structure to mature as Senior Justices become available.

## Conclusion

The Act represents structural judicial reform addressing both balance and accountability. The distinction from ideological court-packing matters. Court-packing -- adding seats to change immediate outcomes -- triggers an arms race with no stopping principle and destroys institutional legitimacy. The Act ties Court size to circuit organization, phases expansion across multiple administrations, creates a regular replacement schedule that treats all future presidents equally regardless of party, diffuses the power of the Chief Justice position through automatic rotation, and establishes binding ethics enforcement with structural safeguards against weaponization.

The reform addresses genuine structural problems: population imbalance across circuits, arbitrary appointment opportunities based on actuarial chance, national anxiety over justice health and longevity, concentration of power in a single Chief Justice for decades, the collapse of confirmation norms, and the absence of enforceable ethical standards. It does so through mechanisms that work regardless of which party holds power at any given moment.

The Act does not predetermine judicial outcomes, mandate particular judicial philosophies, or remove any sitting justice. It does not allow punishment of justices for their judicial opinions, votes, or legal interpretations. It creates conditions for a well-functioning judiciary -- equal representation, predictable appointments, a dignified career structure, diffused leadership, qualified judges, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability -- without dictating what that judiciary should decide.
