# Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

## Implementation Timeline

### Published February 2025

Based on Rev 1.7 of the Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act

---

## Timeline Overview

The Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA), hereafter "the Act," unfolds across three phases spanning approximately fifteen years from enactment to steady-state operation. The phased approach serves critical purposes: it spreads appointment opportunities across multiple administrations, allows the judicial system to absorb changes incrementally, and demonstrates successful operation before reaching full implementation.

All dates below assume enactment with an effective date of January 1, 2026, as specified in Section 403(a). If enacted later, all subsequent dates shift accordingly.

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Phase One: Circuit Reorganization | Years 1-2 | New circuit structure operational January 1, 2028 |
| Phase Two: Court Expansion | Years 2-12 | Full 15-member Court achieved by 2037 |
| Phase Three: Three-Phase Career Structure | Year 11+ | Automatic CJ rotation begins 2037; regular replacement begins 2039 |
| Ethics Infrastructure | Years 1-12+ | IG appointed by 2027; Bridge Panel active until ~2039 |

## Effective Date Architecture

### Immediate Upon Enactment (January 1, 2026)

**Transparency requirements take effect.** All provisions of Title III apply immediately to any Supreme Court justice nominated after the effective date. This includes:

- Documentation requirements (50 works of substantial legal analysis)
- Six qualifying documentation pathways (judicial, scholarly, advocacy, legislative, executive, professional works)
- Subject matter diversity requirement (3 of 6 specified areas)
- Nominee statements (professional biography, 5,000-word judicial philosophy statement)
- Public disclosure requirements (72 hours for documentation, 45 days before confirmation vote)
- Senate Judiciary Committee completeness determination (14 days)
- 120-day Senate consideration timeline

**Ethics provisions take effect.** The Code of Conduct for United States Judges becomes binding on all Supreme Court justices. Mandatory recusal documentation requirements (Section 502) apply immediately to all justices.

**Existing justices protected.** Justices serving on January 1, 2026 may continue in active service indefinitely or voluntarily elect Senior Justice status at any time. No sitting justice is removed; no salary is reduced.

**Administrative Office begins boundary development.** The 180-day clock for circuit boundary proposals begins.

**Ethics infrastructure initiation.** The process for establishing the Ethics Review Panel and appointing the Judicial Inspector General begins.

### Within 180 Days (By June 30, 2026)

**Circuit boundary development complete.** The Administrative Office of the United States Courts must:

- Divide national population into fifteen approximately equal segments
- Assign each segment to a numbered regional circuit
- Ensure no circuit serves more than 110% or less than 90% of average population
- Prioritize geographic contiguity where feasible
- Submit proposed boundaries for Congressional review

### Within One Year (By January 1, 2027)

**First Judicial Inspector General appointed.** Per Section 508(d)(1):

- Nominating Committee convenes (Comptroller General or designee, two retired circuit chief judges by lottery, ABA president or designee)
- Committee identifies candidates meeting qualifications (15+ years Article III service or equivalent, no felony convictions, no political party leadership within 10 years, no close family relationship to sitting or recent justices)
- Committee submits three candidates to the Ethics Review Panel (or Bridge Panel if Panel not yet constituted)
- Panel selects Inspector General for ten-year non-renewable term

**Bridge Panel constituted (if needed).** If fewer than five Senior Justices are available:

- Administrative Office maintains roster of eligible retired circuit chief judges (15+ years Article III service)
- Clerk of the Supreme Court conducts public lottery to select Bridge Panel members
- Bridge Panel members serve until Senior Justices become available or matters are resolved

### First January 1 at Least 24 Months After Enactment (January 1, 2028)

**New circuit structure takes effect.** The fifteen regional circuits become operational. This date allows:

- 18+ months for courts, states, and practitioners to prepare
- Time for additional circuit judge appointments
- Orderly reassignment of existing judges by primary residence
- Adjustment of case routing and administrative systems

### First Odd-Numbered Year at Least 18 Months After Enactment (2027)

**Court expansion begins.** The President nominates the first additional Associate Justice. This timing ensures:

- Expansion begins after circuit reorganization is underway
- At least one full year of preparation before first expansion appointment
- Appointments occur on predictable biennial schedule thereafter

### Within 180 Days of Ethics Review Panel Achieving Quorum

**Ethics Review Panel adopts initial rules of procedure.** Per Section 508(d)(3), the Panel must adopt rules addressing:

- Receiving and reviewing reports from the Inspector General
- Providing respondent justices with notice and opportunity to be heard
- Deliberation and decision-making procedures
- Issuance and publication of decisions

### Eleven Years After First Expansion Appointment (2037)

**Automatic Chief Justice rotation begins.** The first justice appointed under the expansion schedule (appointed 2027) commences their eleventh year of active service and automatically becomes Chief Justice. This marks the beginning of the automatic rotation system:

- No separate nomination or confirmation required
- The justice serves as Chief Justice for years eleven and twelve of active service
- Upon completing year twelve, the justice transitions to Senior Justice status
- The next most senior Associate Justice who has not served as Chief Justice assumes the role

### Twelve Years After First Expansion Appointment (2039)

**Regular replacement schedule begins.** The most senior justice appointed under the expansion schedule completes their Chief Justice term and transitions to Senior Justice status, creating the first regular replacement vacancy. From this point forward:

- One justice transitions from Chief Justice to Senior Justice each odd-numbered year
- Each four-year presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities
- The system operates predictably indefinitely

**Transition period for Title V ends (approximately).** When five justices appointed under the expansion schedule have transitioned to Senior Justice status, the Bridge Panel mechanism is no longer needed:

- Ethics Review Panel consists entirely of Senior Justices
- En Banc Senior Body has sufficient membership for full appellate review
- Bridge Panel members complete service on any pending matters

---

## Phase Two: Court Expansion (2027-2037)

Court expansion proceeds gradually with one additional Associate Justice appointed each odd-numbered year. This distributes appointments across multiple administrations and prevents any single president from dominating the expanded Court.

### Expansion Schedule

| Year | Appointment | Court Composition | Presidential Term |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2027 | 1st expansion | 10 members | Term ending Jan 2029 |
| 2029 | 2nd expansion | 11 members | Term ending Jan 2033 |
| 2031 | 3rd expansion | 12 members | Term ending Jan 2033 |
| 2033 | 4th expansion | 13 members | Term ending Jan 2037 |
| 2035 | 5th expansion | 14 members | Term ending Jan 2037 |
| 2037 | 6th expansion | 15 members (full composition) | Term ending Jan 2041 |

### Expansion Phase Characteristics

**Distributed appointment opportunities.** Assuming standard presidential terms, expansion appointments are distributed across at least three different administrations. No single president receives more than two expansion appointments unless they serve multiple terms.

**Transparency requirements apply throughout.** Every expansion nominee must satisfy Title III requirements: 50 works of substantial legal analysis across six qualifying pathways, subject matter diversity, mandatory nominee statements, and 120-day Senate consideration timeline.

**Existing justices unaffected.** Justices serving before the Act's effective date continue in active service. They are not subject to the three-phase career structure or automatic Chief Justice rotation. The existing Chief Justice continues in that capacity until death, voluntary election of Senior Justice status, or removal.

**Chief Justice transition period.** Until automatic rotation begins in 2037, the Chief Justice serving on the effective date continues in that capacity. Upon commencement of automatic rotation, the existing Chief Justice reverts to Associate Justice status and may continue in active service or elect Senior Justice status. If a vacancy in the Chief Justice position occurs before automatic rotation begins, the President designates a replacement from among sitting Associate Justices, subject to Senate confirmation, to serve until automatic rotation begins.

**Ethics enforcement operational throughout.** The Inspector General receives and investigates complaints. The Ethics Review Panel (supplemented by Bridge Panel as needed) adjudicates findings and imposes sanctions.

---

## Phase Three: Three-Phase Career Structure and Regular Replacement (2037+)

Beginning eleven years after the first expansion appointment, the three-phase career structure becomes fully operational. Each justice progresses through Associate Justice (years 1-10), Chief Justice (years 11-12), and Senior Justice (year 13+).

### Chief Justice Rotation and Replacement Schedule

| Year | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2037 | 1st automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2027 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2038 | CJ continues | Justice appointed 2027 serves year 12 as Chief Justice |
| 2039 | 1st replacement; 2nd automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2027 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed 2029 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2040 | CJ continues | Justice appointed 2029 serves year 12 as Chief Justice |
| 2041 | 2nd replacement; 3rd automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2029 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed 2031 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2042 | CJ continues | Justice appointed 2031 serves year 12 as Chief Justice |
| 2043 | 3rd replacement; 4th automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2031 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed 2033 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2045 | 4th replacement; 5th automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2033 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed 2035 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2047 | 5th replacement; 6th automatic CJ | Justice appointed 2035 transitions to Senior Justice; Justice appointed 2037 becomes Chief Justice (year 11) |
| 2049 | 6th replacement | Justice appointed 2037 transitions to Senior Justice |
| 2051+ | Continuing cycle | Pattern continues indefinitely |

### Ethics Infrastructure Maturation

| Year | Ethics Milestone | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| 2039 | 1st Senior Justice from expansion | First justice appointed under Act reaches Senior Justice status |
| 2041 | 2nd Senior Justice from expansion | Two expansion-appointed Senior Justices available |
| 2043 | 3rd Senior Justice from expansion | Three expansion-appointed Senior Justices available |
| 2045 | 4th Senior Justice from expansion | Four expansion-appointed Senior Justices available |
| 2047 | 5th Senior Justice from expansion; Transition period ends | Five expansion-appointed Senior Justices available; Bridge Panel no longer needed for Panel quorum |
| 2049+ | Steady state | Ethics Review Panel consists entirely of Senior Justices |

### Steady-State Characteristics

**Predictable presidential opportunities.** Every four-year presidential term includes exactly two appointment opportunities (two odd-numbered years). This equalizes influence across administrations regardless of party.

**Three-phase career structure.** Each justice serves through three distinct phases:
- **Associate Justice (Years 1-10):** Hearing and deciding cases, full participation in Court deliberations
- **Chief Justice (Years 11-12):** Leading the Court and federal judiciary, presiding over sessions and conferences
- **Senior Justice (Year 13+):** Reduced-duty status with full Article III protections and life tenure; eligible for Ethics Review Panel service

**Two-year Chief Justice terms.** Each justice serves as Chief Justice for their final two years of active service (years eleven and twelve). This provides sufficient time for administrative leadership while ensuring regular rotation and diffusing power that would otherwise concentrate in a single individual.

**Every justice serves as Chief Justice.** Under the automatic rotation system, every justice who completes a full term serves as Chief Justice. The position becomes a capstone to distinguished service rather than a selective appointment based on presidential preference and actuarial chance.

**Seniority-based succession.** The most senior Associate Justice who has not previously served as Chief Justice automatically assumes the role upon commencing their eleventh year. This ensures orderly succession and prevents any justice from being passed over.

**Senior Justice status preserves Article III protections.** Transitioning justices retain full constitutional protections, salary, benefits, and life tenure. They may continue hearing cases by Chief Justice assignment, sit on circuit courts by designation, serve on the Ethics Review Panel, or decline assignments without penalty.

**Voluntary early transition permitted.** Any justice may elect Senior Justice status before completing ten years as Associate Justice, forgoing service as Chief Justice and creating an immediate vacancy. This provides flexibility while maintaining the regular schedule as the default.

**Ethics enforcement at full capacity.** With multiple Senior Justices available, the Ethics Review Panel operates with full Senior Justice membership. The En Banc Senior Body provides robust appellate review capacity. The Inspector General continues with ten-year terms providing institutional stability.

---

## Sequencing Requirements

Certain provisions must occur in sequence; others may proceed in parallel.

### Sequential Dependencies

1. **Boundary development must precede circuit reorganization.** The Administrative Office must complete population-based boundary proposals before new circuits can take effect.

2. **Circuit reorganization provides basis for Court expansion.** The principled justification for fifteen Associate Justices -- one per regional circuit -- requires the circuit structure to be established or underway before expansion begins.

3. **Expansion must precede regular replacement.** The twelve-year clock for Senior Justice transition begins only for justices appointed under the expansion schedule. Regular replacement cannot begin until at least twelve years after the first expansion appointment.

4. **Expansion must precede automatic Chief Justice rotation.** The eleven-year clock for Chief Justice rotation begins only for justices appointed under the expansion schedule. Automatic rotation cannot begin until at least eleven years after the first expansion appointment.

5. **Chief Justice term precedes Senior Justice transition for each justice.** Each justice becomes Chief Justice upon commencing year eleven, then transitions to Senior Justice upon completing year twelve. The Chief Justice term immediately precedes the Senior Justice transition.

6. **Inspector General appointment before full ethics operations.** While the Code of Conduct becomes binding immediately, investigation and adjudication of complaints requires the Inspector General to be appointed and the Ethics Review Panel (or Bridge Panel) to be constituted.

7. **Expansion-appointed Senior Justices must accumulate before Bridge Panel can retire.** The transition period for Title V ends only when five justices appointed under the expansion schedule have reached Senior Justice status, ensuring the Ethics Review Panel can function without Bridge Panel supplementation.

### Parallel Tracks

- **Transparency requirements and circuit reorganization** proceed independently. Title III applies immediately while Title I phases in over two years.

- **Ethics enforcement and circuit reorganization** proceed independently. Title V takes effect immediately while Title I phases in over two years.

- **Circuit judge appointments and Supreme Court expansion** may proceed in parallel. Additional circuit judges for the reorganized circuits do not depend on Supreme Court composition.

- **Existing justice decisions** are independent. Sitting justices may voluntarily elect Senior Justice status at any time without affecting the expansion or replacement schedule.

- **Inspector General appointment and circuit boundary development** may proceed in parallel. Both occur within the first year but do not depend on each other.
