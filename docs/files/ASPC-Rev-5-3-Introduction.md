# American Shared Prosperity Compact

## Economic Infrastructure for Stability and Shared Prosperity

### Published February 2026

Based on Rev 5.3 of the American Shared Prosperity Compact

---

The American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC) is a legislative framework establishing integrated economic infrastructure across the American lifecycle. The framework addresses three interconnected gaps in the current economic system: payment access, adult stability, and child investment.

Over 20 million American households lack reliable access to the banking system, paying billions annually in check-cashing fees and predatory financial products. Working Americans face economic volatility without the baseline income floor that peer nations provide. American families bear extraordinary costs during the years most critical for child development, without the child allowances common in other developed economies. These gaps compound across generations, transmitting economic precarity from parents to children.

The ASPC addresses all three gaps through a unified legislative framework. Each component act solves real problems independently while achieving maximum efficiency when operating together. The modular architecture enables passage as an omnibus package when political conditions permit, or separate passage across multiple legislative sessions when they do not.

## Components

- **American Payment Network Act (APNA)** -- Establishes a nationwide payment network providing every American with access to a fee-free Network Account for receiving and sending funds, accessible through mobile apps, web portals, ATMs, and physical locations including U.S. Postal Service facilities.

- **American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** -- Provides monthly American Prosperity Stability Payments (APSP) to American adults, combining a $200/month baseline available to approximately 90% of adults with income-adjusted stability payments for lower-income households. Funded by the American Prosperity Contribution (APC) at 12%, with 20% of revenue (~$312 billion annually) shared with state governments.

- **Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** -- Establishes a permanent, fully refundable Child Stability Payment of $600/month ($7,200/year) per child plus a $2,400 Birth Support Payment upon birth or adoption. Funded by the Child Security Contribution at 1.50% of income with an additional 3.00% on high incomes.
