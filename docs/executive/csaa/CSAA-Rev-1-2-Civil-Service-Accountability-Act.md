# THE CIVIL SERVICE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

## Establishing Professional Standards, Transparency, and Merit-Based Service in the Federal Civil Service

### Revision 1.2

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Civil Service Accountability Act (CSAA) transforms the federal civil service from a politicized patronage system into a professional meritocracy modeled on the United States military officer corps. By establishing a principled framework limiting political appointments to approximately 400-450 positions (0.2% of federal employment, bounded by floor of 400 and ceiling of 600), creating transparent performance standards, establishing fixed-term Senior Professional Service positions with Senate confirmation, implementing enhanced revolving door restrictions, and instituting rigorous accountability mechanisms, the CSAA ensures that government operates with the same professionalism, continuity, and non-partisan service that Americans expect from their armed forces.

**Core Principles:**

- Professional expertise serving under civilian control
- Transparent accountability through public performance reviews and oversight
- Merit-based advancement rewarding excellence, not patronage
- Non-partisan service to the Constitution, not political parties
- Institutional continuity across administrations
- Effective execution of elected officials' policy directives
- Protection against revolving-door corruption

**The Model:** Just as Americans trust career military officers -- from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to combatant commanders -- to defend the nation under civilian leadership, the CSAA brings the same professionalism to civil service. Career professionals who know their jobs, serve fixed terms spanning multiple administrations, take oaths to the Constitution, face rigorous accountability while executing the lawful directives of elected officials, and transition to post-government careers without conflicts of interest.

## FINDINGS AND PURPOSE

### Section 101. Congressional Findings

Congress finds that:

(1) **Institutional Memory Crisis.** The current system of approximately 4,000 political appointments creates institutional amnesia every 4-8 years, forcing each administration to relearn lessons at taxpayer expense and undermining effective governance.

(2) **Dysfunction Creates "Deep State" Perception.** The over-politicization of executive branch positions creates the very dysfunction that fuels conspiracy theories about unaccountable bureaucrats, when in fact the problem is incompetent political appointees operating without professional expertise or institutional knowledge.

(3) **Military Model Works.** The United States military demonstrates that professional officer corps serving under civilian control -- with career advancement based on merit, fixed terms for senior officers, Senate confirmation for flag officers, and oath to the Constitution -- can operate with exceptional professionalism, accountability, and effectiveness while preserving democratic control.

(4) **International Best Practice.** Peer democracies (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) maintain professional civil services with 50-150 political appointments compared to America's 4,000, demonstrating superior governmental effectiveness, policy continuity, and institutional competence.

(5) **Constitutional Authority.** Congress possesses constitutional authority under Article I, Section 8 to establish offices and prescribe regulations for civil service, as demonstrated by the Pendleton Act (1883), Classification Act (1923), Civil Service Reform Act (1978), and numerous precedents including fixed terms for FBI Directors (10 years) and Federal Reserve governors (14 years).

(6) **Current System Fails All Parties.** Political appointees lack expertise to execute policy effectively, career civil servants operate in shadows due to political distrust, elected officials cannot achieve their policy goals due to incompetent execution, and taxpayers fund waste, fraud, and repeated mistakes.

(7) **Transparency Ensures Accountability.** Public performance reviews, Inspector General oversight, congressional testimony requirements, and transparent removal procedures provide genuine accountability superior to the current system where incompetent political appointees face no consequences for failure.

(8) **National Security Implications.** Government departments require the same institutional continuity, professional expertise, and operational effectiveness as the Department of Defense to address challenges including pandemics, economic crises, cybersecurity threats, climate change, and international competition.

### Section 102. Statement of Purpose

The purposes of this Act are to:

(1) **Establish Professional Civil Service.** Create a three-tier professional civil service modeled on military officer corps structure, with clear ranks, merit-based advancement, professional development requirements, and transparent accountability.

(2) **Ensure Institutional Continuity.** Provide fixed terms for Senior Professional Service positions that span multiple administrations, preserving institutional knowledge, international relationships, and operational expertise across electoral cycles.

(3) **Enhance Democratic Accountability.** Require Senate confirmation for senior civil servants, mandate public performance reviews, strengthen Inspector General oversight, and establish transparent removal procedures that balance presidential authority with professional continuity.

(4) **Restore Competent Execution.** Enable elected officials to achieve their policy objectives through professional civil servants who execute lawful directives effectively, rather than incompetent political appointees who undermine presidential agendas through inexperience.

(5) **Eliminate Patronage.** Replace political loyalty tests with merit-based hiring, competitive examinations, performance evaluations, and career advancement based on excellence rather than campaign contributions or personal connections.

(6) **Reduce Waste.** Save taxpayer dollars by ending the repetitive cycle of institutional knowledge loss, policy mistakes, operational failures, and administrative chaos that accompanies mass turnover every 4-8 years.

(7) **Depoliticize Administration.** Establish non-partisan service to the Constitution through oaths, ethics requirements, and prohibitions on partisan political activity, ensuring civil servants serve the American people rather than political parties.

(8) **Create Transparent Accountability.** Implement public performance reviews, congressional oversight, Inspector General investigations, and for-cause removal procedures that provide genuine accountability while protecting competent civil servants from political purges.

### Section 303. Military Analogy Framework

The professional civil service structure shall operate under principles analogous to the United States military:

(a) **Civilian Control.** Just as military officers serve under the President as Commander in Chief and civilian Secretary of Defense, professional civil servants serve under the President as Chief Executive and civilian Cabinet Secretaries.

(b) **Professional Expertise.** Just as military officers develop expertise through career progression, professional development, and institutional experience, civil servants shall advance through merit-based promotion and specialized training.

(c) **Institutional Continuity.** Just as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and combatant commanders serve fixed terms spanning multiple administrations, Senior Professional Service members provide continuity across electoral cycles.

(d) **Oath to Constitution.** Just as military officers swear allegiance to the Constitution rather than any individual, civil servants shall take identical oaths of office.

(e) **Transparent Accountability.** Just as military officers face Inspector General oversight, congressional testimony, performance evaluations, and courts-martial, civil servants face parallel accountability mechanisms.

## TITLE IV: REDUCTION AND REFORM OF POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS

### Section 601. Findings on Over-Politicization

Congress finds that the expansion of political appointments from approximately 200 in the 1960s to over 4,000 today has:

(2) Created excessive turnover and knowledge loss

(3) Filled positions with unqualified loyalists rather than competent professionals

(4) Increased revolving-door corruption between government and lobbying

(6) Generated dysfunction that fuels "deep state" conspiracy theories

(7) Exceeded the capacity of any administration to properly vet and manage appointees

### Section 602. Limitation on Political Appointments

(a) **General Principle**

Political appointments shall be limited to positions genuinely requiring policy-making discretion, political judgment, or confidential relationship with elected officials, and shall not extend to operational, technical, or administrative positions appropriate for professional civil service.

## CONCLUSION

The Civil Service Accountability Act represents fundamental reform of the federal civil service, transforming it from a politicized patronage system into a professional meritocracy modeled on the United States military. By establishing a principled framework limiting political appointments to approximately 400-450 positions (0.2% of federal employment, bounded by floor of 400 and ceiling of 600), creating transparent accountability mechanisms, establishing the Senior Professional Service with fixed terms and Senate confirmation, implementing enhanced 5-year revolving door restrictions, and instituting rigorous merit-based systems, the CSAA ensures that the American people receive the professional, competent, and non-partisan government service they deserve.

Just as Americans trust career military officers to defend the nation under civilian control, the CSAA establishes trust in career civil servants to serve the nation under democratic leadership. Professional expertise, institutional continuity, transparent accountability, non-partisan service, and protection against conflicts of interest -- these principles made America's military the finest in the world. The Civil Service Accountability Act brings those same principles to the civil service, creating government as professional as our armed forces.

**The result:** Government that works. Policies executed effectively. Taxpayer dollars spent wisely. Institutional knowledge preserved across administrations. Democratic accountability maintained. Revolving-door corruption eliminated. And the end of the dysfunction that fuels "deep state" conspiracy theories.

**The Civil Service Accountability Act -- professional government serving the American people, with integrity from service through retirement.**
