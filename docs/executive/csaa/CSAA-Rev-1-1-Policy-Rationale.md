# Civil Service Accountability Act

## Policy Rationale

### Published January 2025

Based on Rev 1.1 of the Civil Service Accountability Act

---

## Overview

The United States federal government suffers from a unique dysfunction: approximately 4,000 political appointments -- 20-80 times more than peer democracies. This over-politicization creates institutional amnesia every 2-4 years, enables revolving-door corruption, and produces the very "deep state" behavior it is meant to prevent.

The Civil Service Accountability Act (CSAA) addresses this crisis by establishing a professional civil service modeled on the U.S. military officer corps. By limiting political appointments to approximately 400-450 positions (0.2% of federal employment), creating a Senior Professional Service with fixed terms and Senate confirmation, implementing 5-year revolving door restrictions, and instituting transparent accountability mechanisms, the CSAA transforms federal governance from patronage-based chaos into professional excellence.

The core insight: Americans trust career military officers to defend the nation under civilian control because they operate with professional standards, transparent accountability, and non-partisan service. The CSAA brings these same principles to civil service, eliminating dysfunction while preserving constitutional executive authority.

## Part I: The Problem

### The Crisis of Over-Politicization

In 1960, the federal government had approximately 200 political appointments. By 2025, that number has exploded to over 4,000 -- a 2,000% increase. This expansion created four interconnected crises.

**Institutional Amnesia.** Average political appointee tenure is 18-36 months. Every position experiences constant turnover: months 1-6 learning the job, months 7-18 actually performing competently, months 19-36 preparing exit and networking for the next job, and by month 37 gone with institutional knowledge lost.

**The Competence Crisis.** Political appointments are often made for reasons unrelated to competence -- campaign donations, political connections, demographic balancing, or clearing house for campaign staff. The result is incompetent execution of policy, wasted taxpayer money, and program failures.

**The Vetting Failure.** No administration can properly vet 4,000 appointees. The result is ethics violations, scandals, security risks, and corruption.

**Example: COVID-19 Response.** The Trump administration dismantled the NSC pandemic preparedness office. Career experts warned of pandemic risks. Political appointees dismissed warnings. When COVID-19 hit, institutional knowledge was gone. Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths and trillions in economic damage resulted -- not from malice, but from structural incompetence caused by over-politicization.

### The "Deep State" Paradox

The "deep state" criticism contains truth: a permanent bureaucracy with significant discretion can resist or reshape political direction. But the actual "deep state" is created by over-politicization, not prevented by it.

The causal chain operates as follows: the President appoints 4,000 political loyalists throughout government; most are incompetent or inexperienced; career staff must work around them to keep government functioning; this looks like "resistance" when it is actually competence; political appointees complain about "unaccountable bureaucrats"; the proposed solution is more political appointments; and the cycle repeats, making the problem worse.

**The Military Counterexample.** Nobody accuses career generals and admirals of being "deep state." Why? Because they operate with professional standards, transparent oversight (Congressional, IG, GAO), real consequences (courts-martial, removal), civilian control (SecDef sets policy, military executes), constitutional oath, and a cultural ethos of service over self. These are exactly what civil service needs -- and what the CSAA provides.

### The Revolving Door Problem

The "revolving door" describes legalized corruption. In government, officials make decisions benefiting private entities. After leaving government, they get hired by those entities at multiples of their government salary. The implicit quid pro quo is clear: "Help me now, I'll hire you later."

Current restrictions are toothless: 1-2 year cooling-off periods, narrow "lobbying" definitions, no employment restrictions, and minimal enforcement. The scale of the problem is staggering: 75% of senior financial regulators join financial firms within 5 years, 60% of senior Pentagon officials join defense contractors within 3 years, and average salary increases range from 300-500%.

The public cost is substantial. When officials make decisions with an eye toward post-government employment, regulations are weakened, contracts are awarded poorly, safety is compromised, and taxpayer money is wasted.

### International Comparison

The United States is a dramatic outlier among advanced democracies. Germany operates with approximately 50 political appointments, the United Kingdom with approximately 100, and Canada with approximately 150. The United States operates with approximately 4,000 -- a ratio of 1:525 compared to 1:10,000 in Germany.

America ranks 16th in government effectiveness and 27th in corruption perceptions -- below every peer democracy with professional civil service. The evidence strongly suggests professional civil service reduces corruption and improves governance.

## Part II: The Solution

### The Military Model

The U.S. military is the most effective in the world because of professional excellence. Officers earn positions through merit, serve fixed terms spanning administrations, take oaths to the Constitution, face rigorous accountability, and maintain institutional continuity while executing civilian directives.

Why does no one accuse the military of being "deep state"? Career professionals serve for decades. Institutional culture and priorities exist. Officers maintain relationships across administrations. They can resist political direction through professional advice. Yet no conspiracy theories about "rogue generals" emerge, nor calls to politicize the military. The difference is structural: clear mission and professional standards, transparent oversight, real consequences, civilian control, constitutional oath, and cultural ethos of service over self.

**The Chairman of Joint Chiefs Model.** The Chairman serves a 4-year term, is Senate confirmed, is the highest-ranking military officer, provides professional advice, executes presidential directives, serves multiple administrations, cannot be arbitrarily fired, and maintains critical relationships. General Milley served under Trump and Biden -- nobody called him "deep state." He was professional.

The CSAA maps this model onto civil service: Deputy Secretaries become CS-1 (10-year terms), Undersecretaries become CS-2 (8-year terms), with merit-based advancement below.

### The Three-Tier Structure

**Tier 1: Political Leadership (~400-450 positions).** These positions set policy direction, make political judgments, and represent presidential priorities. The formula allocates 0.2% of federal employment (floor 400, ceiling 600) across five categories: Executive Office of the President (100-150), Cabinet Leadership (90-100), Diplomatic/Regulatory (100-120), Legal (80-100), and Schedule C (50).

**Tier 2: Senior Professional Service (CS-1 to CS-3).** These positions execute policy professionally, maintain institutional relationships, and preserve expertise. CS-1 (Deputy Secretary level) serves 10-year terms with Senate confirmation. CS-2 (Undersecretary level) serves 8-year terms with Senate confirmation. CS-3 (Assistant Secretary/SES level) holds career positions. All are subject to for-cause removal only, public performance reviews, and enhanced retirement.

**Tier 3: Career Civil Service (CS-4 to CS-15).** These positions deliver services, provide technical expertise, and advance through merit. CS-4 to CS-10 constitute the professional corps (like officers), while CS-11 to CS-15 constitute career service (like enlisted). Merit-based hiring and promotion with performance accountability applies throughout.

### Flexible Framework for Political Appointments

The formula in Section 602(c) establishes that the limit equals the greater of 0.2% of federal civilian employment or 400 positions (floor), with an absolute maximum of 600 positions (ceiling). With current employment of approximately 2.1 million, this yields 420 positions.

This framework works because it is adaptable (scales with government size automatically), bounded (cannot balloon to 4,000 or starve the executive), principled (formula-based rather than arbitrary), emergency-ready (+50 temporary positions during crises), transparent (public database tracks all appointments), and enforceable (violations trigger automatic freeze).

### Enhanced Revolving Door Restrictions

For SPS Officers (CS-1 to CS-3), the CSAA establishes a 5-year ban on lobbying the former agency, a 5-year ban on employment with regulated entities, a 5-year ban on employment with contractors, a 3-year ban on any appearance before the former agency, and a lifetime ban on foreign government representation.

Broad definitions close loopholes. "Lobbying" includes strategic advising, arranging meetings, and de facto influence. "Regulated entities" includes trade associations, law firms, and think tanks. "Contractors" includes all tiers, grantees, and public-private partnerships.

Real enforcement includes civil penalties of $250K per violation, criminal prosecution with prison up to 5 years, pension forfeiture, disgorgement of compensation, and permanent employment ban. Monitoring includes OGE tracking of all departing SPS officers, quarterly officer reporting under penalty of perjury, a public database of post-government employment, and whistleblower rewards (10-30% of penalties, maximum $1M).

Why 5 years works: it is long enough that relationships decay, information stales, and deals move on. Officers cannot simply wait it out -- this forces a genuine career choice between public service and private gain.

### Accountability Mechanisms

**Public Performance Reviews.** CS-1 and CS-2 receive annual public performance evaluations with 360-degree input from supervisors, subordinates, peers, Congress, IGs, and stakeholders. A five-level rating scale creates consequences: Outstanding/Exceeds ratings merit bonuses while Unsatisfactory ratings constitute grounds for removal.

**Inspector General Oversight.** IGs receive enhanced authority including unannounced inspections, unrestricted access, and subpoena power. Fixed 7-year terms with removal protection ensure independence. Mandatory investigations cover SPS misconduct, political interference, and whistleblower complaints. Quarterly and annual public reports maintain transparency.

**Congressional Testimony.** SPS officers must testify when requested with complete and truthful testimony required. Protection from retaliation covers candid advice and identifying problems. Annual written reports to relevant committees maintain ongoing oversight.

**Whistleblower Protections.** Comprehensive protection from retaliation covers disclosure to IGs, OSC, Congress, GAO, and DOJ. Remedies include reinstatement, back pay, compensatory damages, and disciplinary action against retaliators. Confidentiality is protected, with disclosure of identity constituting a criminal offense.

**For-Cause Removal.** Grounds include incompetence, misconduct, insubordination, and malfeasance. Policy disagreement, political affiliation, and unwelcome advice do not constitute grounds. Due process requires notice, hearing, representation, IG review, and appeals. Presidential authority is preserved, but procedures create political costs for arbitrary removal.

## Part III: Addressing Concerns

### For Conservatives: Draining the Swamp Through Professionalism

Conservatives express legitimate concerns about unaccountable bureaucrats, waste/fraud/abuse, "deep state" resistance, and revolving door corruption. However, more political appointees backfire -- they create incompetence, increase dysfunction, strengthen "deep state" by forcing workarounds, waste money, and undermine presidential agendas through poor execution.

The CSAA conservative solution drains the swamp through public performance reviews, for-cause removal, and IG oversight. It controls "deep state" through professional standards that eliminate the dysfunction creating it. It ends the revolving door through 5-year bans with serious penalties. It applies the trusted military model to civil service.

Conservative values are embodied throughout: accountability (can fire bad performers), efficiency (professional competence), limited government (90% reduction in patronage), rule of law (clear standards), and anti-corruption (revolving door closed).

Bottom line: when conservatives win, their policies get executed effectively by competent professionals.

### For Progressives: Protecting Expertise and Democracy

Progressives express legitimate concerns about political interference with science, threats to expertise, democratic backsliding, and regulatory capture.

The CSAA protects through fixed terms (cannot purge climate scientists for climate science), for-cause only removal (cannot fire epidemiologists for pandemic advice), Senate confirmation (expertise gets democratic legitimacy), whistleblower protection (report political interference safely), and 5-year revolving door restrictions (prevents regulatory capture).

The guardrails include Senate confirmation, for-cause removal, due process, bipartisan balance, IG independence, Congressional oversight, judicial review, and public transparency.

Bottom line: when progressives win, competent civil service implements progressive policies effectively.

### For Federal Employees: Professional Careers

Federal employees want job security based on performance, career advancement, protection from political interference, fair treatment, respect, and professional development.

The CSAA provides professional protection through fixed terms, for-cause only removal, and due process. It provides career advancement through clear paths (CS-1 to CS-15), merit-based promotion, and no political glass ceiling. It provides respect through the military model comparison and professional standards. It provides enhanced support through required training, competitive compensation, and better retirement. It provides strong protections through whistleblower protection, IG oversight, and Congressional access.

Bottom line: the CSAA represents the strongest protection for federal employees in decades, combined with the highest professional standards.

## Part IV: Constitutional and Legal Framework

The CSAA's constitutional design rests on well-established precedents and carefully preserves presidential authority while creating professional civil service. Congressional authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 includes authority to establish civil service structures, as demonstrated by the Pendleton Act (1883), Classification Act (1923), and Civil Service Reform Act (1978).

Presidential authority is preserved: the President retains executive power, appoints SPS officers with Senate consent, can remove for cause, and Cabinet remains political setting policy direction. Existing precedents support the design: FBI Director (10-year term), Federal Reserve Governors (14-year terms), Comptroller General (15-year term), and military officers (fixed terms with Senate confirmation for flag rank).

For detailed constitutional and legal analysis, see the companion document: *CSAA Constitutional and Legal Analysis*.

## Part V: Economic Analysis

The current system of approximately 4,000 political appointments imposes massive costs: turnover costs of approximately $3 billion annually, mistake costs of $10-20 billion annually, corruption costs of $15-25 billion annually, and efficiency losses of $20-30 billion annually -- totaling $50-75 billion in annual waste.

CSAA implementation requires investment: initial implementation costs of approximately $500 million over Years 1-2, enhanced compensation costs of approximately $1.3 billion annually, and oversight enhancement costs of approximately $500 million annually -- totaling $2-3 billion annually.

CSAA benefits substantially exceed costs: reduced turnover savings of approximately $2.5 billion annually, competent execution savings of $5-10 billion annually, reduced corruption savings of $9-15 billion annually, and efficiency gains of $8-12 billion annually -- totaling $25-40 billion in annual benefits.

The net annual benefit is $22-37 billion with a return on investment of 10-20x. Even conservative assumptions cutting all benefit estimates in half still yield net benefits of $10-18 billion annually.

For detailed cost-benefit analysis, see the companion document: *CSAA Economic Analysis*.

## Conclusion: The Case for Action

### Why Now

The problem is visible: pandemic response failures, regulatory failures, government shutdowns, constant scandals -- dysfunction is obvious to everyone. The solution is proven: the military model works, international precedents work, evidence is clear. The politics are possible: bipartisan appeal, military analogy unassailable, addresses concerns across the spectrum. The alternative is worse: current trajectory leads to more dysfunction, more corruption, more distrust, weaker democracy.

### What Success Looks Like

Five years after implementation: political appointments reduced to approximately 420, SPS officers Senate-confirmed and operating, performance review system showing results, revolving door violations prosecuted, Government Effectiveness ranking rising.

Ten years after implementation: full implementation complete, institutional knowledge preserved through multiple transitions, Corruption Perceptions ranking improved, public trust in government higher, both parties have experienced professional execution of their agendas.

### The Moral Imperative

For democracy: effective governance strengthens democracy while incompetent government breeds cynicism and authoritarianism. For public service: federal employees deserve to be treated as professionals with respect, support, and accountability. For taxpayers: Americans deserve government that works, not a wasteful patronage system. For future generations: we owe them functional institutions, not permanent dysfunction.

### Call to Action

The Civil Service Accountability Act represents the most important government reform opportunity in decades. It addresses fundamental problems with proven solutions. It appeals across the ideological spectrum. It can actually pass and work.

The question is not whether we can afford to pass the CSAA. The question is whether we can afford not to.

American democracy deserves government as professional as our military. The Civil Service Accountability Act makes it possible.
