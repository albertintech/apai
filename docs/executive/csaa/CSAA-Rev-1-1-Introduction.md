# Civil Service Accountability Act

## Establishing Professional Standards and Accountability in the Federal Civil Service

### Published January 2026

Based on Rev 1.1 of the Civil Service Accountability Act

## Overview

The Civil Service Accountability Act (CSAA) transforms the federal civil service from a politicized patronage system into a professional meritocracy modeled on the United States military officer corps. The United States currently operates with approximately 4,000 political appointments -- 20 to 80 times more than peer democracies such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada. This over-politicization creates institutional amnesia with each administration change, enables revolving-door corruption, and produces the dysfunction that fuels "deep state" concerns.

The CSAA addresses these problems by applying the same principles that make America's military the most effective in the world: professional expertise under civilian control, merit-based advancement, fixed terms spanning administrations, transparent accountability, and non-partisan service to the Constitution. Just as Americans trust career military officers to defend the nation while executing civilian directives, the CSAA establishes trust in career civil servants to serve the nation under democratic leadership.

## Key Components

- **Three-Tier Professional Structure** -- Establishes a civil service organized like the military: Senior Professional Service (CS-1 to CS-3) for strategic leadership, Professional Civil Service Officer Corps (CS-4 to CS-10) for operational management, and Career Civil Service (CS-11 to CS-15) for foundational workforce.

- **Senior Professional Service** -- Creates fixed-term positions at Deputy Secretary (10 years), Undersecretary (8 years), and Assistant Secretary (6 years) levels with Senate confirmation, providing institutional continuity across administrations.

- **Political Appointment Limits** -- Reduces political appointments from approximately 4,000 to 400-450 positions (0.2% of federal employment) through a principled formula with floor of 400 and ceiling of 600.

- **Enhanced Revolving Door Restrictions** -- Implements 5-year bans on lobbying, employment with regulated entities, and employment with contractors for senior officers, with meaningful enforcement including civil penalties, criminal prosecution, and pension forfeiture.

- **Accountability Mechanisms** -- Requires public performance reviews for senior officers, strengthens Inspector General oversight, mandates Congressional testimony, and establishes comprehensive whistleblower protections.

- **Merit-Based Systems** -- Replaces political loyalty tests with competitive examination, performance evaluation, and career advancement based on excellence rather than patronage.

- **For-Cause Removal** -- Preserves presidential removal authority while requiring documented cause and due process, preventing arbitrary political purges while enabling removal of incompetent or unethical officers.
