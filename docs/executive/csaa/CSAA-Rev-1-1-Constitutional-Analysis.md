# Civil Service Accountability Act

## Constitutional and Legal Analysis

### Published January 2025

Based on Rev 1.1 of the Civil Service Accountability Act

## Overview

CSAA's constitutional design rests on well-established precedents and carefully preserves presidential authority while creating professional civil service. This analysis addresses three key questions: congressional authority to establish CSAA's structure, presidential authority under Article II, and precedents supporting fixed terms and for-cause removal.

---

## Congressional Authority

Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 grants Congress authority "To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution" federal powers. This includes authority to establish civil service structures. The Necessary and Proper Clause has been interpreted broadly to enable Congress to create administrative structures supporting constitutional functions.

Historical precedent firmly establishes this authority:

- **Pendleton Act of 1883**: Established merit-based civil service
- **Classification Act of 1923**: Created structured position grades
- **Civil Service Reform Act of 1978**: Reorganized civil service systems

Each represented major congressional restructuring of executive branch employment. Constitutional challenges to these acts failed. CSAA represents the next evolution of congressionally-established civil service structures.

Congress also possesses authority to prescribe qualifications for offices, establish appointment procedures, and impose removal standards within constitutional limits. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress authority to establish offices ("Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper"). This includes authority to structure these offices, establish qualifications, and prescribe procedures.

## Presidential Authority Preserved

CSAA carefully preserves presidential authority under Article II while creating professional civil service. Three aspects of presidential power are particularly relevant: appointment authority, removal authority, and executive power generally.

### Appointment Power

CSAA preserves presidential appointment power -- the President nominates all SPS officers subject to Senate confirmation. This tracks the constitutional design for other federal officers. The President retains complete discretion over whom to nominate. Senate confirmation adds democratic accountability but does not diminish presidential nomination power.

### Removal Authority

CSAA preserves presidential removal authority while imposing for-cause standards and procedural requirements. This design has extensive constitutional precedent. The President can remove SPS officers for incompetence, misconduct, failure to execute lawful directives, ethical violations, or criminal conduct. These grounds cover legitimate bases for removal while preventing arbitrary political purges.

Importantly, CSAA imposes *political costs* and *procedural requirements* for removal, not absolute prohibitions. The President must provide written justification, give notice and opportunity to respond, and face potential appeals -- but ultimate removal authority remains. This design mirrors other constitutionally-upheld removal restrictions.

### Executive Power

CSAA does not diminish general executive power. Cabinet Secretaries -- the President's direct subordinates -- remain political appointees serving at pleasure. They set policy direction and make final decisions on major initiatives. The President retains authority to supervise executive branch operations, require written opinions from principal officers, and direct policy implementation.

Professional civil servants execute presidential directives -- they do not set policy independently. When Presidents lawfully direct policy changes, professional civil servants implement those changes regardless of personal views. Professional protection enables resistance to *unlawful* directives but not resistance to *unpopular* directives.

## Supreme Court Precedents

Multiple Supreme Court precedents support CSAA's constitutional design.

### Humphrey's Executor v. United States (1935)

Upheld for-cause removal protections for Federal Trade Commission members. The Court held that Congress can impose removal restrictions for positions requiring independence from direct political control. While distinguishing "purely executive" positions from "quasi-legislative" or "quasi-judicial" positions, the Court established that some removal restrictions are constitutional.

### Morrison v. Olson (1988)

Upheld for-cause removal provisions for independent counsel. The Court held that removal restrictions do not violate separation of powers if they do not "impede the President's ability to perform his constitutional duty." The test is whether restrictions interfere with presidential functions, not whether they impose any constraint.

### Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (2010)

Struck down "double for-cause" removal restrictions (President could remove SEC commissioners only for cause, who could remove PCAOB members only for cause). However, the Court explicitly reaffirmed that single-layer for-cause removal is constitutional. CSAA imposes only single-layer removal restrictions.

### Seila Law v. CFPB (2020) and Collins v. Yellen (2021)

Struck down removal restrictions for single-director agencies (CFPB and FHFA). However, the Court distinguished multi-member bodies and emphasized that single directors wielding substantial power with complete removal insulation create unique constitutional problems. CSAA avoids this by creating multi-member SPS (not single directors) and preserving presidential removal authority for cause.

---

## Existing Fixed-Term Precedents

Several existing federal positions operate with fixed terms and for-cause removal protections that have been upheld or never successfully challenged:

| Position | Term Length | Statutory Authority |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| FBI Director | 10 years | 28 U.S.C. Section 532 |
| Federal Reserve Governors | 14 years | 12 U.S.C. Section 242 |
| Comptroller General | 15 years | 31 U.S.C. Section 703 |

These fixed terms with for-cause removal have operated for decades without successful constitutional challenge.

### Military Officer Precedent

Military officers serve fixed terms for senior positions, face Senate confirmation for flag rank, and enjoy due process protections against arbitrary removal. This structure closely parallels CSAA's design for senior civil servants and has operated since the founding without constitutional objection.

## CSAA Constitutional Design Features

CSAA's design incorporates lessons from these precedents:

**Presidential Appointment Power Preserved**: The President nominates all SPS officers. Senate confirmation adds democratic accountability but maintains presidential nomination discretion.

**Presidential Removal Authority Maintained**: The President can remove for cause -- incompetence, misconduct, failure to execute lawful directives. These grounds enable removal of failing officers while preventing arbitrary political purges.

**Procedural Requirements, Not Prohibitions**: Written justification, notice and opportunity to respond, and appeal rights impose political costs and procedural requirements but do not absolutely prohibit removal. The President faces consequences for arbitrary removal, encouraging proper use of removal authority.

**Multi-Member SPS, Not Single Directors**: CSAA creates SPS with hundreds of officers across agencies, not single directors wielding concentrated power. This avoids constitutional problems identified in Seila Law.

**Limited to Appropriate Functions**: Professional civil service covers administrative, operational, and technical functions requiring expertise and continuity. Policy-making positions remain political appointments.

**Severability**: If courts strike any provision, remaining provisions continue operating. This protects core reforms if specific design elements prove problematic.

## Responding to Constitutional Challenges

CSAA will likely face constitutional challenges arguing that fixed terms and for-cause removal violate Article II presidential authority. The response rests on the precedents outlined above:

1. **FBI Director 10-year terms** provide direct precedent for fixed-term executive branch positions
2. **Federal Reserve governor 14-year terms** demonstrate even longer terms are constitutional
3. **Military officer fixed terms** show the model works for positions involving substantial executive authority
4. **Morrison v. Olson** establishes that restrictions not impeding presidential constitutional duties are permissible
5. **CSAA preserves removal authority** -- it imposes procedural requirements and political costs, not absolute prohibitions

Even if courts strike specific provisions, severability enables core reforms to continue. If necessary, constitutional amendment can provide additional certainty, though statutory CSAA should survive judicial review based on existing precedent.

---

## Conclusion

CSAA's constitutional design draws on decades of precedent establishing that Congress may structure executive branch employment, impose qualification requirements, establish fixed terms, and require for-cause removal procedures -- all while preserving presidential appointment power and removal authority for legitimate grounds. The design avoids pitfalls identified in recent cases by creating multi-member professional service (not single directors) and maintaining presidential removal authority (with procedural requirements rather than prohibitions).

Constitutional challenges are likely but precedent favors CSAA's carefully designed structure.
