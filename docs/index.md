The American Policy Architecture Institute develops structural reforms designed to address foundational challenges in American governance. Our approach treats policy design as institutional engineering — combining rigorous analysis with political realism to produce proposals that are both substantively sound and strategically viable.

## The ASPC Framework

The American Stability and Prosperity Compact is a coordinated package of three reforms addressing economic security, payment infrastructure, and child welfare. Together, they demonstrate how interconnected policy challenges benefit from integrated solutions.

**American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** — Restructures the social safety net to provide universal economic security while simplifying administration and reducing bureaucratic overhead.

**American Payment Network Act (APNA)** — Establishes public payment infrastructure to reduce transaction costs, enhance financial inclusion, and support efficient distribution of public benefits.

**Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** — Reforms child welfare funding and administration to prioritize family stability and improve outcomes for vulnerable children.
