## Flagship Proposals

### 🏛️ Congressional Modernization Framework (CMF)

The Congressional Modernization Framework addresses structural challenges in American electoral and legislative systems through integrated modernization. The current system — winner-take-all elections, a House fixed at 435 members since 1913, and procedural rules that incentivize obstruction — produces predictable dysfunction regardless of which party holds power.

The Framework combines two coordinated components:

**Federal Elections Modernization Act (FEMA)** — Establishes House expansion toward cube root compliance, STAR voting for all federal elections, and multi-member districts with proportional representation for House elections. The Act includes a tiered implementation structure delivering results on a human timescale.

**Office of Congressional Procedure Act (OCP)** — Creates procedural infrastructure for effective multiparty governance, including proportional committee assignments and floor time allocation regardless of which coalition holds the majority.

### 💰 American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC)

The American Shared Prosperity Compact addresses economic security through coordinated modernization of payment infrastructure, income support, and child benefits. Current systems are fragmented, administratively complex, and exclude millions from basic financial services. These interconnected problems require integrated solutions.

The Compact combines three components designed to function independently while integrating powerfully when combined:

**American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** — Establishes a universal stability payment providing baseline economic security for adult Americans, funded through a broad-based consumption mechanism and administered through simplified enrollment.

**American Payment Network Act (APNA)** — Creates public payment infrastructure providing every American access to a fee-free digital account, enabling efficient delivery of public benefits and reducing transaction costs for unbanked and underbanked households.

**Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** — Makes the expanded Child Tax Credit permanent at $3,600/$3,000 per child, with monthly payments, dedicated funding through the Child Security Contribution, and automatic stabilization mechanisms.

## Additional Proposals

### Congress & Elections

**Congressional Capacity Commission Act (CCC)** — Establishes an independent commission to assess congressional institutional capacity and recommend investments in staff, technology, and expertise. Congress has experienced significant capacity erosion relative to the executive branch it oversees.

**Candidate Verification and Transparency Act (CVTA)** — Creates standardized verification processes for federal candidates, ensuring biographical claims are confirmed through systematic procedures rather than adversarial discovery.

### Executive Branch

**Civil Service Accountability Act (CSAA)** — Modernizes federal workforce accountability mechanisms while strengthening protections against politicization. The Act addresses the dual challenges of removing poor performers and maintaining professional independence.

### Federal Judiciary

**Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA)** — Restructures the federal judiciary to address population-based representation, predictable appointments, and qualification standards. The Act establishes a three-phase career structure for Supreme Court Justices — Associate Justice for ten years, Chief Justice for two years, then Senior Justice — combined with fifteen justices aligned to population-based circuits and predictable biennial appointments.

## In Development

Additional proposals covering taxation and healthcare are in active development. Each follows the same methodology: identify structural dysfunction, design integrated solutions, provide complete legislative blueprints.
