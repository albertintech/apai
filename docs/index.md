## Flagship Proposals

### 🏛️ Congressional Modernization Framework (CMF)

The Congressional Modernization Framework addresses structural challenges in American electoral and legislative systems through integrated modernization. The current system — winner-take-all elections, a House fixed at 435 members since 1913, and procedural rules that incentivize obstruction — produces predictable dysfunction regardless of which party holds power.

The Framework combines two coordinated components:

**Federal Elections Modernization Act (FEMA)** — Establishes House expansion toward cube root compliance, STAR voting for all federal elections, and multi-member districts with proportional representation for House elections. The Act includes a tiered implementation structure delivering results on a human timescale.

**Office of Congressional Procedure Act (OCP)** — Creates procedural infrastructure for effective multiparty governance, including proportional committee assignments and floor time allocation regardless of which coalition holds the majority.

### ⚖️ Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act (FJBAA)

The Federal Judicial Balance and Accountability Act restructures the federal judiciary to address structural dysfunctions that no single reform can solve in isolation. Federal circuits reflect nineteenth-century boundaries rather than contemporary population distribution. The Supreme Court has maintained nine justices since 1869 despite dramatic population growth. Judicial appointments depend on actuarial chance rather than principled constitutional design. The binary single-nominee confirmation model concentrates maximum leverage in the Senate's ability to reject. And the Supreme Court remains the only court in the federal system without binding ethical rules or meaningful enforcement.

The Act addresses these interconnected problems through five integrated titles:

**Title I: Federal Circuit Reorganization** — Establishes fifteen population-based regional circuits using federal judicial districts as building blocks, with a structured five-year compliance assessment cycle and tiered rebalancing framework.

**Title II: Supreme Court Composition and Appointments** — Aligns the Court with circuit structure through fifteen justice positions, a three-phase career structure (Associate Justice, Co-Chief Justice, Senior Justice), shared leadership, vacancy coverage through Senior Justice rotation, and appointment equalization ensuring each presidential term includes exactly five appointment opportunities at steady state.

**Title III: Transparency and Evaluative Standards** — Establishes evidence-based documentation requirements ensuring nominees possess comprehensive evaluable records, calibrated for multi-nominee evaluation under the slate-based process.

**Title IV: Implementation and Fairness Provisions** — Phases reforms over multiple years, with slate-based nomination using BLOC STAR voting and transparency requirements effective immediately. Constitutional protections are explicitly preserved: no sitting justice is removed, no salary is reduced, and "good behavior" tenure remains intact.

**Title V: Judicial Ethics and Accountability** — Creates binding ethical standards enforced through a Judicial Inspector General and Ethics Review Panel composed of Senior Justices, with graduated sanctions including mandatory early transition to senior status.

### 💰 American Shared Prosperity Compact (ASPC)

The American Shared Prosperity Compact addresses economic security through coordinated modernization of payment infrastructure, income support, and child benefits. Current systems are fragmented, administratively complex, and exclude millions from basic financial services. These interconnected problems require integrated solutions.

The Compact combines three components designed to function independently while integrating powerfully when combined:

**American Prosperity and Stability Act (APSA)** — Establishes a universal stability payment providing baseline economic security for adult Americans, funded through a broad-based consumption mechanism and administered through simplified enrollment.

**American Payment Network Act (APNA)** — Creates public payment infrastructure providing every American access to a fee-free digital account, enabling efficient delivery of public benefits and reducing transaction costs for unbanked and underbanked households.

**Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** — Makes the expanded Child Tax Credit permanent at $3,600/$3,000 per child, with monthly payments, dedicated funding through the Child Security Contribution, and automatic stabilization mechanisms.

## Additional Proposals

### Congress & Elections

**Congressional Capacity Commission Act (CCC)** — Establishes an independent commission to assess congressional institutional capacity and recommend investments in staff, technology, and expertise. Congress has experienced significant capacity erosion relative to the executive branch it oversees.

**Candidate Verification and Transparency Act (CVTA)** — Creates standardized verification processes for federal candidates, ensuring biographical claims are confirmed through systematic procedures rather than adversarial discovery.

### Executive Branch

**Civil Service Accountability Act (CSAA)** — Modernizes federal workforce accountability mechanisms while strengthening protections against politicization. The Act addresses the dual challenges of removing poor performers and maintaining professional independence.

## In Development

Additional proposals covering taxation and healthcare are in active development. Each follows the same methodology: identify structural dysfunction, design integrated solutions, provide complete legislative blueprints.
