# American Policy Architecture Institute

**Evidence-based civic systems maintenance**

---

The American Policy Architecture Institute develops structural reforms designed to address foundational challenges in American governance. Our approach treats policy design as institutional engineering -- combining rigorous analysis with political realism to produce proposals that are both substantively sound and strategically viable.

Each proposal includes complete legislative text, policy rationale, and supporting documentation. We believe serious reform requires serious detail.

## Reform Portfolio

### 🗳️ Congressional Modernization Act (CMA)

Comprehensive reform addressing congressional dysfunction through integrated electoral and institutional modernization. The Act combines House expansion, STAR voting, multi-member districts with proportional representation, and enhanced legislative capacity -- launching together as a unified system rather than piecemeal changes.

CMA delivers reform on a human timescale: cube root compliance within approximately 14 years, ensuring that members who vote for the Act see results during their careers.

**American Payment Network Act (APNA)** -- Establishes public payment infrastructure to reduce transaction costs, enhance financial inclusion, and support efficient distribution of public benefits.

**Secure Our Children Act (SOCA)** -- Reforms child welfare funding and administration to prioritize family stability and improve outcomes for vulnerable children.
